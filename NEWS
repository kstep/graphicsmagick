Significant changes associated with GraphicsMagick 1.1.1 (not yet released)

  Bug fixes:
    * GraphicsMagick now successfully builds and passes all tests under
    Digital Unix 5.1, using the vendor compiler.
    * Ghostscript sometimes displays an error message and fails, yet it
    returns a success error code to GraphicsMagick. Verify that
    Ghostscript has updated the output file before attempting to use it.
    * Eliminated an out of bounds array access in HuffmanEncode2Image().
    * Fixed a configure script syntax error when testing for trio.

  Utilities enhancements:
    * If gm is executed under a traditional alternate name (e.g.
    convert), it will invoke the appropriate sub-command. This allows use
    of hard links, symbolic links, or just copying 'gm' to the desired
    sub-command name in order to achieve 100% ImageMagick 5.5.2 utility
    compatibility.
    * Provide the --enable-magick-compat option when configuring to install
    ImageMagick utilities compatibility links.

Significant changes associated with GraphicsMagick 1.1 (released April 4, 2004)

  Bug fixes:
    * Semaphore fix which is necessary for proper multi-threaded operation.
    * Configure script fix to ensure that -lfpx is not supplied to the C
    compiler during subsequent tests since this fails on some systems.
    * Fix for East and West gravity computations.
    * System error reports (errno) associated with an exception are now
    correctly obtained from the context existing when the exception was
    thrown rather than the context of the reporting function.
    * JNG encoder fix. Files were being written with incorrect
    alpha_sample_value in the header. These can be repaired by reading
    them into GM 1.1 and rewriting them.
    * XPM fix to module registration.
    * PSD fix for index calculation when QuantumDepth>8.
    * Validate that geometry specifications only include allowed
    characters.
    * SGI fix to save compression type while writing.
    * EXIF attributes were not being retrieved when requested.
    * Fix for bug when reading an image via a user-provided file
    descriptor.
    * The reported image magick string is now always that of the original
    input file (it was sometimes being reported as the format produced by
    an intermediate delegate program).
    * Fixes to color profiling of CMYK images.
    * Memory leak fixed in DrawClipPath().
    * Arc drawing is fixed.
    * Command-line parsing bug under Linux due to Linux's sscanfs
    inability to parse strings like "0x1" as "%fx%f" is fixed.
    * Scaling of 5 and 6-bit colors was slightly incorrect in BMP, AVI,
    DIB, and TIM datastreams.
    * GM utility now reports an error rather than silently returning if
    an unsupported sub-command is provided.

  Performance improvements:
    * Texture tiling is now 7X faster.
    * Color profile processing speed improvements for colormapped images.

  Utilities enhancements:
    * For Unix, 'gm version' now includes a dump of the configure and
    build parameters.
    * Logging of thrown exceptions is now supported. Use '-debug
    exception'. This is useful to learn when and where errors are
    reported.
    * The -define option is added in order to support supplying
    additional options to coders without needing to add additional
    command line options or structure members.
    * The output of 'gm identify -verbose' now provides a nice dump
    of EXIF data.
    * The -sampling-factor option now accepts as many HxV pairs as
    there are JPEG components.  Omitted ones default to 1x1.
    * The convert and montage commands now support an -operator command to
    perform arithmetic and bitwise operations on specified image channels.

  Coder additions/improvments
    * The META coder supports wide characters for the IPTC and 8BIM
    formats.
    * The XTRN coder now supports wide characters.
    * An "IMAGE" coder is provided which provides access to a large
    number of images (derived from XFig) suitable for use as patterns,
    or as test images.
    * The "PATTERN" coder now returns an image pattern tiled to size
    (equivalent results to TILE:IMAGE:pattern). This is for ImageMagick
    compatibility.
    * The CINEON coder now supports reading and writing images in CINEON
    "CIN" linear gray and RGB formats. The read support is still very
    weak, but it works for common images.
    * The JPEG coder now estimates the original JPEG quality and sampling
    factors and will reuse these options when writing JPEG if the image
    is of the same type and the option "-define JPEG:preserve-settings"
    is supplied.
    * The JPEG-2000 coder now supports all Jasper library arguments using
    command line syntax similar to '-define jp2:rate=0.5'.
    * Reading and writting compressed SVG (SVGZ) is now supported.
    * The TXT coder now observes depth when writing.
    * The TIFF coder now outputs colormapped images with 1, 2, 4, and 8
    bits per sample in order to provide much smaller file sizes for
    images with very few colors.
    * Many TIFF coder enhancements. Now reads colormapped and grayscale
    images at arbitrary (even odd) bits-per-sample sizes. Now properly
    supports an opacity channel (at any bits-per-sample value) for
    grayscale images. Bilevel grayscale images are treated similar to any
    other grayscale image unless CCITT FAX3/FAX4 compression is
    requested. Now allows the user to specify an arbitrary
    bits-per-sample value for grayscale images (even odd values) using
    "-define tiff:bits-per-sample=value". Now automatically stores the
    image as TrueColor RGB pixels if the image compression is set to JPEG.
    TIFF files are now written in using the TIFF library's default endian
    order rather than always big endian.
    * The WPG coder now renders embedded WMFs.
    * The PS3 coder is completely re-written to work much better and
    support more features (see ChangeLog).

  Code structure enhancements:
    * Error handling has been improved and validated through testing.
    Some errors were being lost, unnecessarily ignored, or reported as
    something else entirely.
    * The number of error text messages to be maintained has been reduced
    by consolidating similar messages.
    * The memory allocator functions have been replaced with similar
    macros in order to eliminate warnings with GCC 3.3, avoid
    accidentally casting away const, and allow memory debuggers to
    report memory allocations and frees against the correct functions.
    The previously-used functions remain in the library for the purpose
    of compatibility.
    * <magick/xwindow.h> no longer depends on magick_config.h defines.
    * The text string localization code has been replaced with a simpler
    version written by Bill Radcliffe.
    * Added key,value "map" APIs (somewhat similar to C++'s <map>) for
    internal use.

  API enhancements:
    * Incorporated John Cristy's Wand API's in a new GraphicsMagickWand
    library.
    * API definition is no longer dependent on types which vary in size
    (e.g. size_t) depending on large file compilation options.  This means
    that applications may now be compiled without any special large file
    options and still work properly with the library.
    * Thrown exceptions (ExceptionInfo structure) now include source
    file, source line, function name, and current system error number.
    * The GetMagickInfoArray() function is added to replace use of
    GetMagickInfo() for code which needs to access the coder list. This
    is necessary since invoking GetMagickInfo() may re-order the coder
    list, causing problems for code which traverses the list. Using
    GetMagickInfo() to access individual list elements is safe.
    * Added the CopyException function to support copying exception info
    from one structure to another.
    * Added the ReplaceImageInList function to replace an image in an
    image list.
    * Added the DrawPeekGraphicContext function to access the current
    DrawInfo structure in the drawing context stack. Use of this
    function is not recommended since it voilates proper programming
    practices. It is added to support the Wand API's.
    * GetImageDepth() now returns an integral value between 1 and
    QuantumDepth and is no longer limited to the values 8, 16, and 32.
    * SetImageDepth() supports setting the image modulus depth to any
    integral value between 1 and QuantumDepth. This effects the effective
    numeric precision, not the storage depth, since the quantum storage
    type is still a Quantum.
    * GetImageChannelDepth() supports retrieving the modulus depth for a
    specified channel.
    * SetImageChannelDepth() supports setting the modulus depth for a
    specified channel.
    * ProfileImage is updated to handle alpha channels and grayscale
    images.
    * Added GetImageProfile() to retrieve a CMS profile from an image.
    * Added SetImageProfile() to attach a CMS profile to an image without
    adjusting the image pixels.
    * Added DeleteImageProfile() to remove a CMS profile from an image.
    * ConstituteImage() and DispatchImage() now support 'T' (transparency),
    'O' (opacity), and 'P' (pad) options.
    * CompositeImage() now supports CopyCyanCompositeOp,
    CopyMagentaCompositeOp, CopyYellowCompositeOp, and
    CopyBlackCompositeOp, composition operators.
    * GetColorHistogram() obtains a color histogram for the image.
    * QuantumOperatorImage() and QuantumOperatorRegionImage() support
    arithmetic and bitwise operations on specified image channels.
    * The semaphore.h header is no longer installed or included in the
    API headers since these functions are private interfaces.
    * Configure using --enable-symbol-prefix or define
    PREFIX_MAGICK_SYMBOLS to use the C preprocessor to prefix all library
    symbols with "Gm". This prevents library symbol conflicts with other
    libraries.

  PerlMagick fixes:
    * Adjusted a number of function option names so that they match the
    documentation.
    * Memory leak fixed.
    * Reading files (e.g. GIF) via a file descriptor is fixed.

  Build improvements:

    * The TRIO library may be used to provide a replacement for vsnprintf
    if the C library doesn't provide it.  This improves security on old
    systems.
    * Configure only configures for C & C++ languages.
    * Configure now does a better job of figuring out how to build a
    thread-safe library across multiple operating systems.
    * Configure incorporates a new mmap() test which tests the
    functionality which is needed so that mmap() is not unnecessarily
    rejected on a number of systems. This improves performance for large
    files on those systems.
    * Configure/build fixes for IBM's AIX operating system.

  Windows-specific improvements:
    * The static install package now uses the "uninstalled"
    configuration so that it does not depend on the Windows registry in
    order to run. This allows files from the static install package to
    be copied to another computer without running an installer.
    * The executable search path is extended at run-time to include the
    directory where the CORE DLLs reside in order to ensure that they
    are found.
    * Adding the -t option to VisualMagick configure enables building
    all of the coders into one library in order to save build time and
    simplify linkage.
    * The XTRN coder now supports wide characters.
    * LCMS library updated to version 1.10.
    * GMDisplay displays a checkerboard pattern behind transparent images.
    * Support is provided for issuing log messages to the Windows standard
    logging system.
    * Project files are now provided for use with Borland C++ Builder 6.0.
    * Updated LCMS version to 1.12.
    * Updated FreeType version to 2.1.5.
    * Updated JBIG-KIT to version 1.5.
    * Updated libpng to version 1.2.5.
    * Updated libwmf to version 0.2.8.2.
    * Updates zlib to version 1.2.1.
    * ActivePerl 5.8.1 Build 807 now supported.
    * GraphicsMagick now compiles using Visual Studio .NET 2003.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Significant changes associated with GraphicsMagick 1.0 (Released in May, 2003)

  GraphicsMagick support services:
    * Master web site at "http://www.GraphicsMagick.org/".
    * Mailing lists, bug tracking, and forums available via
    "http://sourceforge.net/projects/graphicsmagick/".
    * CVSWeb via "http://cvs.graphicsmagick.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/".
    * CVS via cvs.graphicsmagick.org (find instructions at
    "http://www.graphicsmagick.org/www/cvs.html").
    * FTP via "ftp://ftp.graphicsmagick.org/pub/GraphicsMagick".

  Project maintenance improvements:
    * ChangeLog conforms to the GNU standard and all CVS commits include
    useful log messages.
    * CVS commit messages posted to graphicsmagick-commit mail list.
    * CVS commit messages contain CVSWeb URL references.

  Footprint changes from ImageMagick:
    * Library -lMagick renamed to -lGraphicsMagick.
    * Library -lMagick++ renamed to -lGraphicsMagick++.
    * Utilities consolidated into a single 'gm' utility (e.g. use 'gm
    convert').
    * Script Magick-config renamed to GraphicsMagick-config.
    * Script Magick++-config renamed to GraphicsMagick++-config.
    * Headers installed under ${PREFIX}/include/GraphicsMagick.
    * PerlMagick namespace renamed from "Image::Magick" to "Graphics::Magick".
    * Pkgconfig files GraphicsMagick.pc and GraphicsMagick++.pc are
    installed in $libdir/pkgconfig to assist pkg-config users.
    * Coder modules installed to lib/GraphicsMagick-1.0/modules-Q8/coders.
    * Filter modules installed to lib/GraphicsMagick-1.0/modules-Q8/filters.

  Many performance enhancements:
    * Default QuantumDepth is 8 since this is adequate for most purposes
    and more efficient than 16.
    * The Magick++ demo (compiled with QuantumDepth=8 and -O2) runs about
    1.8X faster under SPARC/Solaris than the same demo with ImageMagick
    5.5.4.
    * Colorspace transformations are much faster.
    * Grayscale/monochrome image handling is much faster.
    * PseudoClass image handling is faster.
    * Text annotations using FreeType are much faster.
    * Image file I/O is much faster.
    * RLE-compressed MIFF reading much faster.

  Code structure enhancements:
    * All utility support functions moved to magick/command.c in order to
    significantly reduce link dependencies, allowing statically-linked
    programs to be smaller.
    * Use of MogrifyImage() elminated except for by utilities.
    * Re-builds due to changes to <magick/image.h> reduced by splitting the
    header into multiple headers.
    * ISO C '99 typedefs (gm_int16_t, gm_uint16_t, gm_int32_t, gm_uint32_t,
    gm_int64_t, gm_uint64_t) are available for use.

  Feature enhancements:
    * Module loader always enabled for shared builds to allow extension.
    * Loading of arbitrary filter modules (via -process option) supported
    under Unix as well as Windows.
    * SVG coder allows specifying size and initial background color.
    * JPEG-2000 coder (JP2) updated to work with Jasper 1.7.
    * HWB and HSL image colorspace translation support.
    * JNG/MNG/PNG format support tracks ImageMagick version.
    * BMP encoder can write 16-color indexed BMPs now as well as 2-color
    BMPs (not restricted to monochrome).
    * TIFF decoder now includes optimized support for tiled and stripped
    TIFF.
    * The -random-threshold option (RandomThresholdImage()) is added to
    threshold an image to bilevel using random thresholding.

  Major bug fixes:
    * 100% successful test completion at all quantum depths (8/16/32).
    * A temporary file management subsystem is added to ensure that all
    temporary files are removed before program exit. Temporary files are
    created and used in a secure fashion to avoid the possibility that a
    "trojan" temporary file (e.g. a symbolic link, or a file containing
    unsafe content) is created before a delegate has the chance to write
    to it. The environment variable MAGICK_TMPDIR allows the user to
    specify where temporary files are created without altering where
    other programs create their temporary files. Temporary filenames are
    created in 8+3 format to hopefully be more acceptable to ralcgm.
    * When dithering is disabled, don't dither when converting to a
    PseudoClass, grayscale, or monochrome image. Disabling dithering
    may cause these translations to be much faster.
    * PICON format works with BLOBs.
    * No longer removes input file when pinging a FlashPIX file.
    * Arc drawing and texture fill fixes from ImageMagick.
    * Sample, scale and affine fixes from ImageMagick.
    * MIFF colormaps are now scaled properly while reading.
    * CMYK translation works for QuantumDepth=32.
    * ConstituteImage now works properly for grayscale images.
    * Built-in tilde expansion and filename globbing now works properly.
    * InitializeMagick now registers signal handlers to ensure that
    resources are released before program exit.  This helps avoid
    temporary file leaks due to the user using "CONTROL-C".
    * The installed <magick/magick_config.h> header now only contains
    the few definitions required by the API headers.  This should
    significantly reduce or eliminate conflicts with other package
    headers.

  Windows platform enhancements:
    * Configure updated for Visual C++ 7.0.
    * OLE object (ImageMagickObject) re-written to work with Visual C++ 7.0
    * New function, CropImageToHBITMAP(), to return a region of the image
    as a Windows HBITMAP.
    * Use vsnprintf to format strings under Windows (safer).

==============================================================
On November 19, 2002, GraphicsMagick was created as a fork of
ImageMagick, several days before the ImageMagick 5.5.2 release.

The objectives of GraphicsMagick are to:

  o Use an open development model.
  o Encourage new developers to join the project.
  o Avoid unnecessary source code "churn".
  o Establish and preserve a stable API.
  o Use efficient coding practices which result in fast code.
  o Improve memory efficiency.
  o Use a release process which assures a working product.
  o Maintain an accurate ChangeLog.
