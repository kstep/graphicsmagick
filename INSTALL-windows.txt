Important Notes

  On some platforms VISUAL C++ 7.0 fails with an internal compiler
  error while compiling image.c.  The workaround to this problem is to
  use the following procedure if the problem is encountered:

   o In the Solution Explorer, select CORE_Magick->src->image.c
   o Select "Properities" (right-mouse menu) to bring up the Property
   Pages for image.c
   o Select "C/C++"->"Optimization"->"Floating-Point Consistency"
   o Select "Improve Consistency (/Op)"

Windows Win2K/95 VISUAL C++ 6.0 and 7.0 COMPILATION

  The Visual C++ distribution targeted at Windows XP, Win2K, or Windows 95
  does not provide any stock workspace (DSW) or project files (DSP) except
  for those included with third party libraries. Instead, there is a
  "configure" program that must be built and run that creates build
  environments to satisfy various requirements.

  The Visual C++ system provides three different types of "runtimes"
  that must match across all application, library, and DLL code that is
  built. The "configure" program creates a set of build files that are
  consistent for a specific runtime selection.

  The three options for runtime support are:

    1) Dynamic Multi-threaded DLL runtimes (VisualDynamicMT).
    2) Static Single-threaded runtimes (VisualStaticST).
    3) Static Multi-threaded runtimes (VisualStaticMT).
    4) Static Multi-threaded DLL runtimes (VisualStaticMTDLL).

  In addition to these runtimes, the VisualMagick build environment allows
  you to select whether to include the X11 libraries in the build or not.
  X11 DLLs and headers are provided with the VisualMagick build
  environment. Most Windows users do not use X11 so they will prefer to
  build without X11 support. When X11 is not supported, gm subcommands
  'animate', 'display', and 'import' will not work.

  This leads to five different possible build options, which should
  cover almost any particular situation. The default binary distribution
  is built using #1 from above with the X11 libraries included. This
  results in an X11 compatible build using all DLL's for everything and
  multi-threaded support (the only option for DLL's).

  To do a build for your requirements, simply go to the configure sub-
  directory under VisualMagick and open the configure.dsw workspace (for
  Visual C++ 6.0) or configure.sln (for Visual C++ 7.0). Set the build
  configuration to "Release" under the

      "Build..., Set Active Configuration..."  menu.

  Build and execute the configure program and follow the on-screen
  instructions. You should not change any of the defaults unless you have a
  specific reason to do so.

  The configure program provides a button entitled

     Edit "magick_config.h"

  Clicking this button brings up magick_config.h in Windows notepad for
  optionally changing any preprocessor defines in GraphicsMagick's
  magick_config.h file. This file is copied to magick\magick_config.h. You
  may safely open magick\magick_config.h, modify it, and recompile without
  re-running the configure program. In fact, using notepad to edit the
  copied file may be preferable since it preserves the original
  magick_config.h file.

  Key user tunables in magick_config.h include:

    QuantumDepth (default 8)

      Specify size of PixelPacket color Quantums (8, 16, or 32) A value of
      8 uses half the memory than 16 and may run 30% faster, but provides
      256 times less color resolution than a value of 16.

    UseInstalledGraphicsMagick (default undefined)

      Define to build an GraphicsMagick which uses registry settings or
      embedded paths to locate installed components (coder modules and
      configuration files). The default is to look for all files in the
      same directory as the executable.

    ProvideDllMain (default undefined)

      Define to include a DllMain() function ensures that the GraphicsMagick
      DLL is properly initialized without participation from dependent
      applications. This avoids the requirement to invoke IntializeMagick()
      from dependent applications but only works for DLL builds.

    Windows95 (default undefined)

      Define to allow binaries to execute under Windows '95. Note that
      enabling support for Windows '95 disables support for the large
      (>2GB) pixel cache, limiting the decompressed image size that can be
      processed. Input and output image files are currently limited to 2GB
      under Windows.

    HasLZW (default undefined)

      Define to enable use of LZW compression in GIF, Postscript, PDF, and
      TIFF. Enabling LZW for TIFF also requires enabling LZW in the TIFF
      library. Note that LZW compression is patented by Unisys (until June,
      2003) so it can not be used without a license.

  After creating your build environment you can proceed to open the DSW (or
  SLN) file that was generated in the VisualMagick directory and build
  everything from there.

  In the final DSW file you will find a project call "All". In order to
  build everything in the distribution, select this project and make it
  the "active" project. Set the build configuration to the desired one
  (Debug, or Release) and do a "clean" followed by a "build". You should
  do the build in a specific way:

    1) Make the "All" project the active project (Bold)
       Right click on the All project and select "Set As Active Project"
    2) Select "Build..., Clean"
    3) Select "Build..., Build"
    4) Go get some coffee unless you have a very fast machine!.

  The "Clean" step is needed in order to make sure that all of the target
  support libraries are updated with any patches needed to get them to
  compile properly under Visual C++.

  All of the required files that are needed to run any of the command
  line tools will be found in the "bin" subdirectory of the VisualMagick
  subdirectory. This includes EXE, and DLL files. You should be able
  to test the build directly from this directory without having to move
  anything to any of the global SYSTEM or SYSTEM32 areas in the operating
  system installation.

  NOTE #1:

  The Visual C++ distribution of GraphicsMagick comes with the Magick++
  C++ wrapper by default. This add-on layer has a large number of demo
  and test files that can be found in GraphicsMagick\Magick++\demo, and
  GraphicsMagick\Magick++\tests. There are also a variety of tests that
  use the straight C API as well in GraphicsMagick\tests.

  All of these programs are NOT configured to be built in the default
  workspace created by the configure program. You can cause all of these
  demos and test programs to be built by checking the box in configure
  that says:

    "Include all demo and test programs"

  In addition, there is another related checkbox (checked by default)
  that causes all generated project files to be created standalone so
  that they can be copied to other areas of you system.

  This is the checkbox:

   "Generate all utility projects with full paths rather then relative
    paths"

  WOW - that a mouthfull - eh?

  Visual C++ uses a concept of "dependencies" that tell it what other
  components need to be build when a particular project is being build. This
  mechanism is also used to ensure that components link properly. In my normal
  development environment, I want to be able to make changes and debug the
  system as a whole, so I like and NEED to use dependencies. However, most
  end users don't want to work this way.

  Instead they really just want to build the package and then get down
  to business working on their application. The solution is to make all
  the utility projects (UTIL_xxxx_yy_exe.dsp) use full absolute paths
  to all the things they need. This way the projects stand on their own
  and can actually be copied and used as templates to get a particular
  custom application compiling with little effort.

  With this feature enabled, you should be able to nab a copy of...
    
    VisualMagick\utilities\UTIL_convert_xxx_exe.dsp  (for C)

     -or-

    VisualMagick\Magick++\demo\UTIL_demo_xxx_exe.dsp (for C++)

  ... and pop it into notepad, modify it (carefully) to your needs and
  be on your way to happy compiling and linking.

  You can feel free to pick any of the standard utilities, tests, or
  demo programs as the basis for a new program by copying the project
  and the source and hacking away.

  The choice of what to use as a starting point is very easy...

  For straight C API command line applications use something from:

    GraphicsMagick\tests or GraphicsMagick\utilities (source code)
    GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\tests or GraphicsMagick\Visualmagick\utilities
      (project - DSP)

  For C++ and Magick++ command line applications use something from:

    GraphicsMagick\Magick++\tests or GraphicsMagick\Magick++\demo
      (source code)
    GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\Magick++\tests or
      GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\Magick++\demo (project - DSP)

  For C++ and Magick++ and MFC windows applications use:
   
    GraphicsMagick\contrib\win32\MFC\NtMagick (source code)
    GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\contrib\win32\MFC\NtMagick
      (project - DSP)

  NOTE #2:

  The GraphicsMagick distribution is very modular. The default
  configuration is there to get you rolling, but you need to make some
  serious choices when you wish to change things around.

  The default options are all targeted at having all the components in one
  place (e.g. the "bin" directory of the VisualMagick build tree). These
  components may be copied to another folder (such as to another computer).

  The folder containing the executables and DLLs should contain the
  following files:

      1) magic.mgk
      2) delegates.mgk (derived from nt.mgk)
      3) modules.mgk
      4) rgb.txt

  The "bin" folder should contains all EXE's and DLL's as well as the
  very important "modules.mgk" file.

  With this default setup, you can use any of the command line tools
  and run scripts as normal. You can actually get by quite nicely this
  way by doing something like "pushd e:\xxx\yyy\bin" in any scripts you
  write to execute "out of" this directory.

  By default the core of GraphicsMagick on Win32 always looks in the place
  were the exe program is run from in order to find all of the files as
  well as the DLL's it needs.

  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

  You can use the "System" control panel to allow you to add and delete
  what is in any of the environment variables. You can even have user
  specific environment variables if you wish.

  PATH

   This sets the default list of places were Windows looks for EXE's and
   DLL's. Windows CMD shell seems to look in the "current" directory first
   - no matter what, which may make it unnecessary to update the PATH. If
   you wish to run any of utilities from another location then you must
   add the path to your "bin" directory in. For instance, you might add:

      D:\CVS\GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\bin

   to do this for the default build environment like I do.

  MAGICK_HOME

   If all you do is modify the PATH variable, the first problem you
   will run into is that GraphicsMagick may not be able to find any of
   its "modules. Modules are all the IM_MOD*.DLL files you see in the
   distribution. There is one of these for each and every file format
   that GraphicsMagick supports. This environment variable tells the system
   were to look for these DLL's. The compiled in "default" is "execution
   path" - which says - look in the same place that the application is
   running "in". If you are running from somewhere other then "bin" -
   this will no longer work and you must use this variable. If you elect
   to leave the modules in the same place as the EXE's (a good idea)
   then you can simply set this to the same place
   as you did the PATH variable. In my case:

      D:\\GraphicsMagick\coders

   This is also the place were GraphicsMagick expects to find the
   "colors.mgk", "delegates.mgk", "magic.mgk", "modules.mgk", and
   "type.mgk" files.

   One cool thing about the modules build of GraphicsMagick is that you can
   now leave out file formats and lighten you load. If all you ever need
   is GIF and JPEG, then simply drop all the other DLL's into the local
   trash can and get on with your life.

   WARNING: Always keep the "xc" format, since IM uses it for internal
   purposes.

  ALSO. You can elect to changes these things the good old "hard-coded"
  way. Two #defines are applicable.

  defines.h has 

      #define MagickConfigurePath  "c:\\GraphicsMagick\\"

  To view any image in a Microsoft window, type

      convert image.ext win:

  Make sure Ghostscript is installed, otherwise, you will be unable to
  convert or view a Postscript document, and Postscript standard fonts will
  not be available.

  You may use any standard web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer) to browse
  the GraphicsMagick documentation.

  The Win2K executables will work under Windows 95/98.
