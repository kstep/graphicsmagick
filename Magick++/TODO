Items large and small which remain to be worked on.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Come up with a way to allow the user to iterate through a list
  of the supported image formats.

* Set scene number to 1 (or 0?) in STL unlinkImages.

* Add read/write methods to support user-supplied BLOBs which are
  supplied in raw form rather than via a Blob object.

* Use verbose flag on image to enable run-time tracing.

* Add microtimer support for image processing operations so that the
  processing time for the last operation is immediately available.

* Add support for OrderedDitherImage().

* Look into adding/removing profiles via the ProfileImage function.
  Need method for adding a profile via ProfileType and void* as well
  as a method for removing a profile via ProfileType.  The ProfileType
  "UndefinedProfile" would remove all profiles.
  Need to reconcile memory allocators between profiles and Blob.

* Extend Image constructor to allow specifying DirectClass or
  PsuedoClass representation when creating a solid-color canvas.

* Add Image constructor that takes only a Geometry argument in order
  to support constructing an image with size, but without content.

* Fix floodFillTexture() so that it preserves the current texture.

* Fix documentation for drawing rounded rectangle.  Parameters
  represent corners, not center.

* Manage Options instance seperate from Image instance.  Possibly take
  this to the extreme by managing each contained structure
  independently.

* Support options stack similar to graphic-context.

* Add support for new drawing primitives:
  - clip-path %s  (%s is the name of the clip path
  - pop clip-path
  - push clip-path-%s  (%s is the name of the clip path)
  - viewbox (e.g. "viewbox 0 0 640 480")

* Support manipulating IPTC profiles directly.

Items which will require the aid of volunteers.  Volunteers?
