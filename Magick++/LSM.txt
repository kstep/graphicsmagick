Title:          Magick++ image processing library (in C++)
Version:        5.2.6
Entered-date:   03DEC00
Description:    Magick++ is a library written in C++ that provides
                a user-friendly interface to the sophisticated
                image-processing capabilities of ImageMagick. Magick++
                supports an object model and API which is inspired by
                PerlMagick, the PERL interface to ImageMagick. Magick++
                provides reference-based garbage collection and
                efficient value-based assignment to make working with
                images no more difficult than working with integers.
                Pointers are not a requirement in order to use Magick++.
                In order to deal with collections of image frames,
                Magick++ is fully integrated with the Standard Template
                Library (STL) so that image frames may be stored in, and
                operated on, in STL containers (e.g. vector and list).
                STL-compatable template versions of ImageMagick's
                list-style operations are provided so that operations
                may be performed on multiple images stored in STL
                containers. Magick++ is platform independent (only
                requiring standard C++) and is currently supported under
                Unix and Windows.
