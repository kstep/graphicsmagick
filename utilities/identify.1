.SH NAME
identify - describe the format and characteristics of one or more image
files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "identify"
[ \fIoptions\fP ... ] \fIfile\fP [ \fIfile\fP ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBidentify\fP describes the format and characteristics of one or more image
files.  It will also report if an image is incomplete or corrupt.
The information displayed includes the scene number, the file name, the
width and height of the image, whether the image is colormapped or not,
the number of colors in the image, the number of bytes in the image, the
format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and finally the number of seconds
it took to read and process the image.  An example line output from
\fBidentify\fP follows:

.nf
     images/aquarium.miff 640x480 PseudoClass 256c 308135b MIFF 1s
.fi

If \fB-verbose\fP is set, expect additional output including any image
comment:

.nf
     Image: images/aquarium.miff
       class: PseudoClass
       colors: 256
       signature: eb5dca81dd93ae7e6ffae99a5275a53e
       matte: False
       geometry: 640x480
       depth: 8
       bytes: 308135
       format: MIFF
       comments:

         Imported from MTV raster image:  aquarium.mtv
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "-cache \fIthreshold\fP"
megabytes of memory available to the pixel cache.

Image pixels are stored in memory until 80 megabytes of memory
have been consumed.  Subsequent pixel operations are cached on disk.
Operations to memory are significantly faster but if your computer does not
have a sufficient amount of free memory you may want to adjust this threshold
value.
.TP
.B "-density \fI<width>x<height>\fP
vertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the image.

This option specifies an image density when decoding a Postscript or
Portable Document page.  The default is 72 pixels per inch in the horizontal
and vertical direction.  This option is used in concert with \fB-page\fP.
.TP
.B "-depth \fIvalue\fP"
depth of the image.  This is the number of bits in a pixel.  The only
acceptable values are 8 or 16.
.TP
.B "-format \fIstring\fP"
output formatted image characteristics.

Use this option to print information about the image in a format of your
choosing.  You can include the image filename, type, width, height,
or other image attributes by embedding special format characters:

.nf
    %b   file size
    %c   comment
    %d   directory
    %e   filename extention
    %f   filename
    %h   height
    %i   input filename
    %k   number of unique colors
    %l   label
    %m   magick
    %n   number of scenes
    %o   output filename
    %p   page number
    %q   quantum depth
    %s   scene number
    %t   top of filename
    %u   unique temporary filename
    %w   width
    %x   x resolution
    %y   y resolution
    \\n   newline
    \\r   carriage return
.fi

For example,

.nf
     -format "%m:%f %wx%h"
.fi

displays \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fB@\fP, the image comment is read
from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.
.TP
.B "-size \fI<width>x<height>+<offset>\fP"
width and height of the image.

Use this option to specify the width and height of raw images whose
dimensions are unknown such as \fBGRAY\fP, \fBRGB\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP.
In addition to width and height, use \fB-size\fP to skip any header
information in the image or tell the number of colors in a \fBMAP\fP
image file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).

For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

.nf
      192x128
      384x256
      768x512
     1536x1024
     3072x2048
.fi

Finally, use this option to choose a particular resolution layer of a JBIG
or JPEG image (e.g. -size 1024x768).
.TP
.B -verbose
print detailed information about the image.

This information is printed:  image name;  the image class
(\fIDirectClass\fP or \fIPseudoClass\fP);  the total number of unique
colors; whether there is a matte associated with the image; the number
of runlength packets; the image size; the depth of the image; the image
format; the image scene; and finally any image comment.  Refer to
\fBmiff(1)\fP for a description of the image class.
