		performance.

Glenn Randers-Pehrson
		Contributed significantly to the utilities, including
		writing the 'gm' utility wrapper. Authored support for
		JNG, MNG, and PNG formats. Provided significant support
		for the BMP format. Significant improvements to the
		documentation, including creating a documentation
		authoring environment based on the <imdoc> format.

Leonard Rosenthol
		Authored the 'conjure' utility and associated MSL
		execution environment. Provided MacOS support. Authored
		the CLIPBOARD, XCF, and PSD coders. Postscript and PDF
		expertise. Significant drawing enhancements including
		support for dash patterns, linecap stroking, clipping
		masks and a mask image.


Lars Ruben Skyum
		Contributed the -clippath functionality, added
		-define support, improved color profile support,
		and re-wrote the PS3 coder.

Non-Member Authors
==================

John Cristy
		Creator, principal author, and principal maintainer of
		ImageMagick, from which GraphicsMagick is originally
		derived (from ImageMagick 5.5.2).  Also the author of
		the Wand API to ImageMagick which is incorporated as
		a stand-alone library by GraphicsMagick.

                coder modules.

Kelly Bergougnoux
		Authored the Cineon coder.

Christopher R. Hawks
		Authored the PALM coder.

Francis J. Franklin
		Ported the WMF coder to the libwmf 0.2 API.

Rick Mabry
		Contributed code to support filling drawn objects using a
		pattern image.
Nathan Brown
		Original author of the JP2 coder.

Kyle Shorter
		Original author of PerlMagick. Original author of the
		LOCALE coder.

Markus Friedl
		Original author of Base64 encode/decode sources.

David Harr
		Contributed (with Leonard Rosenthol) dash pattern,
		linecap stroking algorithm, and minor rendering
		improvements.

Troy Edwards
		Authored the source RPM spec file for GraphicsMagick.

Milan Votava
		Contributed support for Wireless BitMap, used in WAP -
		Wireless Access Protocol.

Mike Edmonds
		Contributed the median filter algorithm.

Additional Acknowledgements
===========================

David Pensak, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company
		For providing the computing environment that made
		developing ImageMagick possible.

Alexander Zimmermann
		Responsible for the ImageMagick Linux binary
		distributions for many years. His efforts are very much
		appreciated.

Paul Heckbert, Carnegie Mellon University
		Image resizing is based on Paul Heckbert's Zoom program.

Paul Raveling, USC Information Sciences Institute
		The spatial subdivision color reduction algorithm is
		based on his Img software.		

Michael Halle, Spatial Imaging Group at MIT
		For the initial implementation of Alan Paeth's image
		rotation algorithm.

Peder Langlo, Hewlett Packard
		Made hundreds of suggestions and bug reports. Without
		Peder, this software would not be nearly as useful as it
		is today.

Rod Bogart and John W. Peterson, University of Utah
		Image compositing is loosely based on rlecomp of the
		Utah Raster Toolkit.

Alvy Ray Smith and Eric Ray Lyons
		HWB color transform and algorithm.

Thomas R Crimmins
		Inventor of the eight hull algorithm used for speckle
		reduction.
