1.4 (not yet released)
======================

Security Fixes:

  * Fixed array underflow on systems using signed char which could
    result in a program crash due to extended characters in filenames
    or in certain file formats.

  * Fix for CVE-2009-1882 "Integer overflow in the XMakeImage
    function".

  * Fix lockup due to hanging in loop while parsing malformed
    sub-image specification (SourceForge issue 2886560).

  * Libltdl: Updated libtool to 2.2.6b in order to fix security issue.
    Resolves CVE-2009-3736 as it pertains to GraphicsMagick.

  * PCX: Detect improper rows, columns, or depth.  Fixes CVE-2008-1097
    "Memory corruption in ImageMagick's PCX coder".

  * DrawDashPolygon: Avoid a crash which sometimes occured with tiny
    polygons.

Bug fixes:

  * Fixed array underflow on systems using signed char which could
    result in a program crash due to extended characters in filenames
    or in certain file formats.

  * When drawing paths, memory allocation for the points was much
    larger than it needed to be (patch by Vladimir Lukianov).

  * Fix "double free" error when using gm import -frame.

  * XPM does not support RGBA color syntax, so return RGB instead.

  * The display '-update' option was only working in conjunction with
    the '-delay' option with a delay setting of 2 or greater.

  * For formats which support multiple frames, output with +adjoin to
    filenames containing a scene specification (e.g. foo%02d.tiff) was
    resulting in wrong output file names.

  * -convolve was crashing rather than reporting an error.

  * Fixed crash if the number of OpenMP threads was reduced from the
    original value via '-limit threads' or omp_set_num_threads().

  * -blur was not blurring the opacity channel for solid-color images.

  * When installing HTML documentation, many files were included which
    are not part of the formatted documentation.

  * Several deleted global string constants are restored with
    deprecated status in order to assure that symbols are not removed
    from the ABI.

  * -convolve, -recolor: Validate that user-provided matrix is square
    when parsing -convolve and -recolor commands in order to avoid a
    core dump.

  * CALS: Reading images taller than the image width resulted in a
    failure.

  * ConstituteImage(), DispatchImage(): 'A' and 'T' should indicate
    transparency and 'O' should indicate opacity.  Behavior was
    inconsistent.  In some cases 'O' meant transparency while in other
    cases it meant opacity. Also, in a few cases, matte was not
    getting enabled in the image as it should.

  * DCRAW: Module name was not registered so modules based builds were
    not supporting formats provided via 'dcraw'.

  * GetOptimalKernelWidth1D(), GetOptimalKernelWidth2D(): In the Q32
    build, convolution kernel size was estimated incorrectly for large
    sigmas on 32-bit systems due to arithmetic overflow.  This could
    cause wrong results for -convolve, -blur, -sharpen, and other
    algorithms which use these functions.

  * Image Size: Fixed the ability to pass the image size via the
    filename specification like "myfile.jpg[640x480]" rather than
    needing to use -size.

  * IPTC: Blob data needed to be padded to an even size.  Size is now
    correctly reported.

  * IPTC: Returned IPTC string values were one character too short.

  * Large Files: Large pixel cache files were not working under GNU
    Linux.

  * JP2: Fixed some value scaling problems.

  * JP2: Fix possible crash at exit when Jasper is used by a modules
    build.

  * MPC: is_monochrome and is_grayscale flags were not managed
    properly for the MPC coder.

  * PCL: Page was not always being ejected.

  * PNG: The png8 encoder would fail when trying to write a 1-color
    image.

  * PSD: PSD parser was confused by 0x0 pixel layers, resulting in
    image data corruption of all following layers.

  * -rotate, -shear: Some internally-reported errors were potentially
    being lost.

  * Subrange/stdin: Commands now support reading an image from stdin
    in conjunction with a subrange specification (e.g. "-[1]").

  * Magick++ STL ShadeImage: Implementation was completely botched.

  * JPEG: Profile chunks need to be concatentated in order to build
    the whole profile.  This was not working so embedded profiles
    larger than 32K or maybe 64K were being corrupted.  This bug was
    introduced in GraphicsMagick 1.2.

  * Meta: Fix memory leaks.

  * Meta: Work better with with IPTC record 2 blocks and deal better
    with IPTC embedded in an 8BIM profile.  Fixes by John Sergeant.

  * MPC: Fix crash when reading MPC and the input image is modified.

  * PNG: Ensure that the opacity channel is properly initialized.

  * -profile: Lowercase arguments were sometimes not working as
    expected.

  * Topol: Topol reader actually works now and is included in test
    suite.

  * TIFF: Read and write JPEG-compressed grayscale TIFF correctly.

  * VisualMagick configure now works properly when output paths are
    specified.

  * WMF: Eliminate memory leaks.

  * Now runs under Windows Vista (as a 32-bit application).

  * Fix for colorspace transform math overflow in Q32 build.

  * RPM build, Fixes to successfully build binary RPMs for Red Hat
    Linux 4.

  * MSL/conjure, Fix bug with attributes becoming appended to
    themselves.  Fix memory leaks.

  * With the -segment option, eliminate trashing the image colors when
    used on huge images.

  * 'identify -format "%c"' now reports the entire comment regardless
    of size.

  * Argument to -convolve is no longer arbitrarily truncated so huge
    convolution kernels may now be specified from the command line.

  * -roll was failing for colormapped images.

  * Composition was failing when the change image overlaps off the
    left side of the canvas.

  * VID: Memory leak fix.

  * PREVIEW: Solarize parameter was wrong.

  * Delegates previously using 'spawn' needed an ampersand so that
    starting the child process does not hang the GUI.

  * BMP: Fix assertion thrown for BMP files with negative image height
    values.

  * EPT, PDF, PS: PDF bounding box is sometimes incorrect or not
    globally applicable so don't specify bounding box when reading PDF
    files.

  * DIB: Fix assertion thrown for DIB files with negative image height
    values.

  * OpenMP: Fix (benign) multi-thread cross-contentions (detected by
    valgrind's Helgrind).

  * TIFF: Fix problem with reading one bit per sample RGB images.

  * TIFF: Writer was using rows-per-strip of 8 when writing
    JPEG-compressed TIFF.  This does not work for vertical
    subsampling, and some TIFF readers insist on 16.  The
    rows-per-strip is now required to be a multiple of 16.

  * TIFF: In some cases, the TIFF reader and writer were accessing
    planar TIFF in row-order rather than plane-order, which resulted
    in sever buffering problems in libtiff, and failure when
    compression was used.

  * -write now works usefully as documented.

  * Magick++: Don't install Magick++ headers if Magick++ is disabled.

  * GraphicsMagick.spec: Install module .la files so that modules can
    be loaded.

  * Temporary file name generator was not random enough, resulting in
    some file name collisions for GraphicsMagick processes started at
    the same time.

  * PerlMagick: Fixed Ping on a BLOB.

  * GetImageDepth was leaking memory.

  * Convert/mogrify -mask option was leaking memory.

  * Mogrify -output-directory option was leaking memory.

  * DPX: Fixed memory leak encountered when subsampling to 4:2:2.

  * DPX: Values read received insuficient scaling, which round-tripped
    correctly, but rounded-down excessively if any image processing
    was applied.

New Features:

  * Added a -thumbnail command to 'convert' and 'mogrify'.  This is a
    faster way to scale down the image when speed is a primary
    concern.

  * Added a -extent command to 'convert' and 'mogrify' which
    composites the image on top of a backing canvas image of solid
    color.

  * Added support for -compose to the 'convert' and 'mogrify', which
    were documented to support it (but did not).

  * CALS Type 1 files may now be written (Work contributed by John
    Sergeant).  CALS support is dependent on the TIFF library.

  * GROUP4RAW encoder supports reading/writing RAW Group4 data.

  * JP2: JPEG 2000 may now be written in arbitrary bit depths ranging
    from 2 to 16 rather than just 8 or 16.

  * JPEG: IJG JPEG library version 7 is now supported.

  * JPEG: Added jpeg:block-smoothing and jpeg:fancy-upsampling defines
    to control these JPEG library options.

  * JPEG: Detect and apply colorspaces appropriately for ITU FAX JPEG.

  * Resource Limits: There is now a "threads" resource limit which
    allows specifying the number of OpenMP threads which may be used,
    similar to the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable.

  * TIFF: Allow CIELAB TIFF to be read.

  * MagickGetImageAttribute()/MagickSetImageAttribute(): New Wand
    methods to support getting and setting an image attribute.
    Contributed by Mikko Koppanen.

  * ClonePixelWand(): New Wand method to deep-copy an existing pixel
    wand.

  * ClonePixelWands(): New Wand method to deep-copy an array of
    existing pixel wands.

  * MagickCdlImage(): New Wand method to apply the ASC CDL to an
    image.

  * MagickGetImageBoundingBox(): New Wand method to return the crop
    bounding box required to remove any solid-color border from the
    image.

  * MagickGetImageFuzz(), MagickSetImageFuzz(): New Wand methods to
    get and set the color comparison fuzz factor.

  * MagickHaldClutImage(): New Wand method to apply a Hald CLUT to an
    image.

  * MagickSetResolution(): New Wand method to set the wand resolution.

  * MagickSetResolutionUnits(): New Wand method to set the wand
    resolution units.

  * Magick++: Allow Magick++ library to built as a DLL under MinGW and
    Cygwin.  This requires a modern GCC in order for C++ exceptions to
    work.

  * MagickWand: New method MagickSetCompressionQuality() to allow
    setting the compression quality.

  * MagickWand: New method CloneDrawingWand() to deep-copy a drawing
    wand.

  * MagickWand: New method DrawGetException() to retrieve information
    regarding the last drawing wand exception (if any).

  * MagickWand: New method DrawClearException() to clear a drawing wand
    exception.

  * Magick++: New Image method cdl() to apply the ASC CDL.

  * Magick++: New Image method colorMatrix() to apply a color matrix
    to the image channels.

  * Magick++: New Image method haldClut() to apply a color lookup
    table (Hald CLUT) to the image.

  * MSL/Conjure: Added a new 'profile' command which applies, adds, or
    removes one or more IPTC, ICC or generic profiles from a file.
    Work contributed by John Sergeant.

  * Added a 'time' subcommand to provide Unix-style 'time' output when
    a 'time' capability is missing, or the reporting format is
    inconsistent.  For example 'gm time convert ...'.

  * Windows build supports OpenMP and requires Windows 2000 or later
    (source code still supports Windows '98).

  * Support large files under Windows.

  * Support reading/writing 16 and 24 bit float TIFF files.

  * Support reading/writing 64 bit integer TIFF files.

  * Added "Log", "Max", "Min", and "Pow" options to -operator.

  * Added HRS reader for slow scan TV (contributed by Fojtik Jaroslav).

  * Pthreads (POSIX threads) API may now be used under the WIN32 API.

  * New access confirmation facility (MagickConfirmAccess) to allow
    the API user to monitor and/or block access to files and URLs.
    This allows the API user to implement a security policy based on
    actual accesses.

  * New color matrix function (ColorMatrixImage) to apply a color
    matrix similar to Adobe Flash Flash.filters.colorMatrixFilter(),
    and Windows GDI+ ColorMatrix class, (order up to 5x5) to the image
    pixels.  This is accessible via the -recolor command option.

  * Added an IDENTITY coder to return a Hald identity CLUT image of
    specified order (e.g. "identity:8").

  * Added a Hald CLUT capability as described at
    http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html.  This allows a
    color transformation to be easily created and replicated on any
    number of images.  The algorithm is accessed by the -hald-clut
    option of 'convert' and 'mogrify'.  Original algorithm by Eskil
    Steenberg and adapted for GraphicsMagick by Clément Follet from
    Workflowers, with additional work by Bob Friesenhahn.

  * Added support for the ASC CDL transform.  Available as -asc-cdl
    via the 'convert' and 'mogrify' subcommands.  Original
    implementation by Clément Follet from Workflowers but considerably
    re-worked by Bob Friesenhahn.  Implementation passes the +/- 1
    count accuracy requirement required by the ASC CDL SOP tests.

  * Added support for reading CALS Type 1 format (contributed by John
    Sergeant).  CALS is a standard raster format used by the US
    Department of Defense for storing blueprint images.

  * Added a random number generation system based on George
    Marsaglia's multiply-with-carry generator.  Somewhat slower than
    rand() but produces better random numbers with a period >2^60.
    This is a much better random number generator than the C library
    rand() and the algorithm is integrated in a way which maximizes
    multi-thread performance.

  * The 'compare' command now supports a -maximum-error option to
    specify the maximum image error so that it may be used to support
    boolean logic in automated test scripts.

  * For OpenMP-builds, the '-list resource' output now indicates the
    number of threads which will be used.

Feature improvements:

  * Cygwin: Cygwin 1.7 is now supported.

  * JPEG compression settings are preserved (if possible) when
    inserting JPEG blobs into formats which use JPEG.

  * PDF: If the original file used JPEG compression, then use JPEG
    compression with original settings (if possible).

  * TIFF: Update Windows build to use libtiff 3.9.2.

  * X11 Display: Apply a checkerboard pattern underneath transparent
    images which use more than simple binary transparency.

  * ColorMatrixImage(): Add opaque opacity channel when needed.

  * PDF & PS: Use '-type palette' prior to input file name to cause
    Ghostscript to return a dithered colormapped image.

  * PNG: Now compiles with libpng-1.4.0beta74 and later.

  * TIFF: Libtiff in Windows build is upgraded to 3.9.1.  This allows
    GraphicsMagick to read and write 16 and 24 bit float TIFF files.

  * Windows code to find Ghostscript is rewritten from scratch.

  * Image resize now avoids adding "halos" around objects when
    resizing an image which contains transparency (patch contributed by
    Pavel Merdin).

  * Debug logging now properly prints 64-bit offset values.

  * New --disable-openmp-slow configure option for disabling use of
    OpenMP for algorithms which may run slower on systems with weak
    memory/cache implementations.

  * DICOM: The DICOM reader is completely re-written and is much more
    functional now.  A few features (e.g. RLE compression) are still
    missing.  This work is contributed by John Sergeant.

  * EXIF: Unprintable characters in EXIF attribute strings are now
    returned using three-digit octal notation.  Unknown tags are
    identified via their four-character hex value.

  * FITS: Parser is more robust (work by Fojtik Jaroslav).

  * JPEG, Allow user to specify DCT encoding method via
    jpeg:dct-method define.  Also allow control over whether huffman
    encoding is used via jpeg:optimize-coding define.

  * PCL: PCL writer is rewritten to fix many bugs, add support for
    compression, add support for 8 bit PseudoClass images, and
    dramatically improve usability (work contributed by John Sergeant).

  * TIFF: Allow the user to force the returned image to be TrueColor
    type for min-is-white and min-is-black TIFF files.

  * TIFF: User can now specify the predictor using syntax like
    '-define tiff:predictor=2'.

  * TIFF: User can now specify the rows-per-strip value when using
    JPEG compression.

  * TXT: The TXT reader is now capable of reading image files written
    by the TXT writer, as well continuing to render ASCII text into an
    image (work contributed by Fojtik Jaroslav).

  * +profile now supports an exclusion syntax.  For example ``+profile
    '!icm,*'`` removes all of the profiles except for the ICM profile.
    The new syntax also allows multiple profiles to be listed at once.

  * Utilities @file.txt syntax for including a list of files to use as
    an argument now really works as expected.  This may be used to
    inject any other text into the command line as well.  As a result,
    the 'mogrify' utility may be invoked on thousands of files at once
    while obtaining the list of files to process from a text file.

  * The 'mogrify' utility now caches argument images so that they are
    loaded only once when mogrify is used to process multiple image
    files.

Performance Improvements:

  * Requests for 'Over' and 'Atop' composition are converted to a
    request for the (faster) 'Copy' composition when both images are
    opaque.

  * Gamma: Performance is improved for Q8 and Q16 builds.  Also
    preserve full precision in Q32 build.

  * String data is dealt with a bit more efficiently (fewer
    allocations, less memory, and less CPU).

  * Drawing of points, lines, and polygons (and complex shapes based
    on these) is now accelerated using OpenMP with excellent speed-up.

  * ICC color transforms now see linear speedup from OpenMP.

  * Rotate: For rotations of 90 or 270 degrees, tile sizes are
    selected more appropriately.

  * Improve resource estimation for Microsoft Windows systems.

  * OpenMP (parallel processing) improvements for these functions:

    - Rotate by 90 and 270 degrees (-rotate)

    - Segmentation (-segment)

  * AdaptiveThreshold, Blur, Convolve, and MotionBlur no longer
    process the opacity channel unless the image has one.

  * 'identify "*"' now successfully works in a 32-bit application when
    used in a directory containing a million files.

  * 'identify' now executes quickly when used on TIFF files.

  * -median and -noise now see reliable linear speedup as threads are
    added.

Behavior Changes:

  * There is no longer an implicit 'adjoin' if an output filename
    contains an apparent scene specification (e.g. foo%02d.tiff) and
    multiple files are not needed to save the image..  It is necessary
    to use +adjoin.  For example ``gm convert foo.pdf +adjoin
    %02d.tiff``.

  * InitializeMagick() MUST be invoked prior to using any Magick API
    function.  Failure to do so will likely lead to an immediate
    application crash.  This is due to initialization and runtime
    changes intended to improve thread safety and efficiency.
    Previously it was only strongly recommended to invoke
    InitializeMagick().

  * ConstituteImage(), DispatchImage(): 'A' and 'T' should indicate
    transparency and 'O' should indicate opacity.  Behavior was
    inconsistent.  In some cases 'O' meant transparency while in other
    cases it meant opacity. Also, in a few cases, matte was not
    getting enabled in the image as it should.

  * colors.mgk: Is now empty to default and is optional.  Previous
    content is now compiled into the library in an efficient way, but
    existing values may be modified, or new values added by adding
    entries to color.mgk.

  * DisableSlowOpenMP is now the default.  Use --enable-openmp-slow to
    enable OpenMP for algorithms which sometimes run slower rather
    than faster.

  * magic.mgk: This configuration file is no longer used since this
    data is now compiled into the library in an efficient way.

  * modules.mgk: Is now empty to default and is optional.  Previous
    content is now compiled into the library in an efficient way, but
    existing values may be modified, or new values added by adding
    entries to modules.mgk.

  * Third party executables not included in the Visual Studio build
    are no longer bundled in the GraphicsMagick installer.  This means
    that hp2xx.exe, mpeg2dec.exe, and mpeg2enc.exe are no longer
    distributed.

  * No longer clear the exception structure at the start of
    ReadImage() and other similar functions since this sometimes masks
    errors.  The API user is expected to make sure that the exception
    structure is clean prior to invoking a function.

  * SVG: Writer is now disabled since it usually does not work properly.

  * PerlMagick is configured but no longer built by default.

  * Use '-interlace Line' to produce an interlaced GIF, PNG, or
    progressive JPEG.

  * JPEG: Removed over-write of image->client_data.

  * PDF: Try to properly deal with reading rotated PDFs.

  * PNG: Fixed crash when writing PNG images with transparency and either
    optimize is requested, or the image is colormapped.

  * Configure: Fixed the --enable-magick-compat configure option, which
    had stopped working.

  * Configure: Fixed --without-magick-plus-plus so that it works again.  This
    stopped working in the 1.2 release cycle.

  * Configure: Fixed MagickLibVersion text string generation so that it
    is now correct when a component of the release number exceeds '9'.
    Now components can safely count up to '99' before there is a problem.

    of the coders based on their stability classification.

  * Use MAGICK_IO_FSYNC environment variable to cause written file to
    be synchronized to disk to avoid possible data loss on power fail.

  * MAT: Now supports reading compressed files.

  * FITS: Now supports 8, 16, 32 bit integer, float, and double images
    and writes correct FITS format.

  * DCRAW: Coder proxy module allows reading digital camera files as if
    they were natively supported.

  * New C API functions:

    - AddNoiseImageChannel(), add noise to an image channel.
    - BlurImageChannel(), blur an image channel.
    - GaussianBlurImageChannel(), gaussian blur an image channel.
    - ImportImageChannelsMasked(), import selected image channels.
    - SharpenImageChannel(), sharpen an image channel.
    - UnsharpMaskImageChannel(), unsharpmask an image channel.
    - New cache view interfaces to correct shortcommings of original
      ones.  New interfaces are AcquireCacheViewPixels(),
      AcquireOneCacheViewPixel(), AcquireCacheViewIndexes(),
      GetCacheViewPixels(), SetCacheViewPixels(), and
      SyncCacheViewPixels(). The deprecated functions are
      AcquireCacheView(), GetCacheView(), SetCacheView(), and
      SyncCacheView().

New Utilities:

  * A 'benchmark' subcommand is now available to benchmark the
    performance of any other arbitrary subcommand (e.g. 'convert').

Feature improvements:

  * LZW compression is now enabled by default.
  * Support industry-standard subsampling notation like "4:2:2".
  * If gm is executed under a traditional alternate name (e.g.
    convert), it will invoke the appropriate sub-command. This allows
    use of hard links, symbolic links, or just copying 'gm' to the
    desired sub-command name in order to achieve 100% ImageMagick 5.5.2
    utility compatibility.
  * Provide the --enable-magick-compat option when configuring to install
    ImageMagick utilities compatibility links.
  * Identify -verbose output includes normalized (0.0-1.0) statistics.
  * Identify and convert now print "pixels per second" rates to help
    evaluate performance.
  * Added the identify +ping option to force reading the complete file.
  * The display program now supports the +progress option to disable any
    visual progress indication (and hourglass cursor) while loading images.
  * Support writing grayscale TGA files.
  * Provide explicit support for Rec 601 and Rec 709 grayscale spaces.
  * Include some support for a log RGB space based on the 2.048 density
    range as defined for the Cineon Digital Film System.
  * Added utilities command-line support for industry standard subsampling
    notation like 4:4:4 and 4:2:2.
  * Use MAGICK_IOBUF_SIZE to tune the size of the I/O buffer.
  * Use -type Bilevel, Grayscale, TrueColor, or TrueColorMatte to
    influence the type of image that Ghostscript returns.
  * Use '-define tiff:fill-order={msb2lsb|lsb2msb}' to control TIFF bit
    fill order.
  * The -version option now dumps a feature list as well as the build
    options.
  * The -endian option now supports the option 'native'.
  * A -monitor is added to enable progress monitoring for the command line
    utilities.
  * Use the -output-directory option to 'mogrify' to send output files to
    the specified directory.
  * Use the -create-directories option in conjunction with
    -output-directory and 'mogrify' to create any necessary subdirectories.
  * A Pixels resource limit is added.  Use '-limit Pixels value' to limit
    the maximum number of pixels in an image to 'value'.
  * The already supported option '-type Optimize' is now honored by
    formats that need to choose a subformat based on the properties of
    the image. Grueling tests of many/all pixels are not performed
    unless '-type Optimize' is supplied.
  * Added a a -set option to the composite, convert, display, mogrify,
    import commands in order to allow setting an image attribute.
  * Display utility no longer defaults to reading from standard input if
    stdin is not a tty.
  * May now be configured to use the umem memory allocation library
    available in Solaris 9, Update 3 and later, or from the portable umem
    project.

Coder additions/improvements:

  * Replaced existing DPX "support" with all-new DPX support conforming
    to the SMPTE 268M-2003 standard.
  * Cineon reader completely rewritten.
  * TIFF coder is completely re-written. Now supports reading and
    writing RGB, CMYK, and grayscale, scanline-oriented TIFF images
    with arbitrary (1 to 32 bits) depth. Includes support for tiled
    TIFF, floating point TIFF, LogLuv TIFF, BigTIFF, arbitrary depths,
    and associated alpha.
  * TIFF coder now supports retrieving and saving XMP profiles.
  * MATLAB support is much improved and supports writing as well.
  * WPG reader now supports CTM translations.
  * ART format now supports writing.
  * Support 32-bit raw RGB images.
  * Support 32-bit raw CMYK images.
  * Support 32-bit raw gray images.
  * JP2 coder reads images in YCbCr colorspace and retrieves an embedded
    ICC ICM color profile if present.

API enhancements:

  * Added ExportImageChannel() and ImportImageChannel() APIs to support
    exporting and importing pixel regions with an arbitary range of (1
    to 32) bits per quantum.
  * Added image leveling methods for Magick++.
  * Generalized GetImageAttribute() support for retrieving wildcarded
    attributes so that an identify -format specification like
    ``"%[dpx:*]"`` works as expected.
  * Incorporated changes changes necessary so that GraphicsMagick can
    work with the Ch C/C++ interpreter from SoftIntegration at
    http://www.softintegration.com/.
  * Added MagickAllocFunctions() to allow the API user to replace the
    underlying memory allocator functions.
  * Added MagickMalloc() and deprecated AcquireMemory().
  * Added MagickCloneMemory() and deprecated CloneMemory().
  * Added MagickMallocArray() to safely allocate N items of size S.
  * Added MagickRealloc() and deprecated ReacquireMemory().
  * Added MagickFree() and deprecated LiberateMemory().

Performance improvments:

  * The DispatchImage() and ConstituteImage() functions incorporate
    special case code for BGR, BGRO, BGRP, RGB, RGBO, and I formats (8
    bit only) in order to improve performance dramatically.
  * When writing very large JPEG images, don't enable Huffman compression
    since doing so requires libjpeg to buffer the entire image in memory.
  * When using the 'identify' -verbose option, -verbose must be specified
    twice in order to obtain the color count.  This makes normal use of
    -verbose much faster.
  * Significantly improved read/write speed for bilevel and gray images.
  * TIFF I/O is considerably faster.
  * Postscript writer is 10-15X faster.
  * PNM formats writer is 10-100X faster.
  * Rotate by 90 or 270 degrees is 2-9X faster.

Windows-specific improvements/changes:

  * For the MinGW and Cygwin builds, the Magick++ library is forced to
    build as a static library since otherwise C++ exceptions don't work.
  * MinGW cross-build is available from a Linux or FreeBSD host.
  * Determine location of Ghostscript fonts only once in order to improve
    performance.
  * Updated bzip2 to 1.0.4.
  * Updated Jasper library to version 1.900.1.
  * Updated jbigkit to 1.6
  * Updated lcms to 1.17
  * Updated libpng to 1.2.27.
  * Updated libtiff to 3.8.2
  * Updated zlib to 1.2.3.
  * Libtiff supports LZW compression.
  * X11 is no longer part of the default build and will not be included
    in the distributed install packages (but can still be built).
  * Find latest Ghostscript which idenfies itself as "GPL Ghostscript".
  * Use GlobalMemoryStatusEx(), if available, to determine how much
    physical memory is available. Important for large-memory machines.
  * Fixed NTreaddir() so that it does not write beyond its buffer.
  * Fixed opendir() emulation function so it can't overwrite the stack.
  * FlashPIX library sources are no longer distributed in the Windows
    source package and building FlashPIX is disabled by default.
    FlashPIX may still be built by adding the library (separately
    distributed).
  * Fix bitmap handle leak in CropImageToHBITMAP() and ImageToHBITMAP().

1.1 (Released April 4, 2004)
============================

Bug fixes:

  * Semaphore fix which is necessary for proper multi-threaded operation.
  * Configure script fix to ensure that -lfpx is not supplied to the C
    compiler during subsequent tests since this fails on some systems.
  * Fix for East and West gravity computations.
  * System error reports (errno) associated with an exception are now
    correctly obtained from the context existing when the exception was
    thrown rather than the context of the reporting function.
  * JNG encoder fix. Files were being written with incorrect
    alpha_sample_value in the header. These can be repaired by reading
    them into GM 1.1 and rewriting them.
  * XPM fix to module registration.
  * PSD fix for index calculation when QuantumDepth>8.
  * Validate that geometry specifications only include allowed
    characters.
  * SGI fix to save compression type while writing.
  * EXIF attributes were not being retrieved when requested.
  * Fix for bug when reading an image via a user-provided file
    descriptor.
  * The reported image magick string is now always that of the original
    input file (it was sometimes being reported as the format produced by
    an intermediate delegate program).
  * Fixes to color profiling of CMYK images.
  * Memory leak fixed in DrawClipPath().
  * Arc drawing is fixed.
  * Command-line parsing bug under Linux due to Linux's sscanfs
    inability to parse strings like "0x1" as "%fx%f" is fixed.
  * Scaling of 5 and 6-bit colors was slightly incorrect in BMP, AVI,
    DIB, and TIM datastreams.
  * GM utility now reports an error rather than silently returning if
    an unsupported sub-command is provided.
  * TIFF coder was writing 16-bit per sample RGB images incorrectly on
    little-endian CPUs.

Performance improvements:

  * Texture tiling is now 7X faster.
  * Color profile processing speed improvements for colormapped images.

Utilities enhancements:

  * For Unix, 'gm version' now includes a dump of the configure and
    build parameters.
  * Logging of thrown exceptions is now supported. Use '-debug
    exception'. This is useful to learn when and where errors are
    reported.
  * The -define option is added in order to support supplying
    additional options to coders without needing to add additional
    command line options or structure members.
  * The output of 'gm identify -verbose' now provides a nice dump
    of EXIF data.
  * The -sampling-factor option now accepts as many HxV pairs as
    there are JPEG components.  Omitted ones default to 1x1.
  * The convert and montage commands now support an -operator command to
    perform arithmetic and bitwise operations on specified image channels.

Coder additions/improvements

  * The META coder supports wide characters for the IPTC and 8BIM
    formats.
  * The XTRN coder now supports wide characters.
  * An "IMAGE" coder is provided which provides access to a large
    number of images (derived from XFig) suitable for use as patterns,
    or as test images.
  * The "PATTERN" coder now returns an image pattern tiled to size
    (equivalent results to TILE:IMAGE:pattern). This is for ImageMagick
    compatibility.
  * The CINEON coder now supports reading and writing images in CINEON
    "CIN" linear gray and RGB formats. The read support is still very
    weak, but it works for common images.
  * The JPEG coder now estimates the original JPEG quality and sampling
    factors and will reuse these options when writing JPEG if the image
    is of the same type and the option "-define JPEG:preserve-settings"
    is supplied.
  * The JPEG-2000 coder now supports all Jasper library arguments using
    command line syntax similar to '-define jp2:rate=0.5'.
  * Reading and writting compressed SVG (SVGZ) is now supported.
  * The TXT coder now observes depth when writing.
  * The TIFF coder now outputs colormapped images with 1, 2, 4, and 8
    bits per sample in order to provide much smaller file sizes for
    images with very few colors.
  * Many TIFF coder enhancements. Now reads colormapped and grayscale
    images at arbitrary (even odd) bits-per-sample sizes. Now properly
    supports an opacity channel (at any bits-per-sample value) for
    grayscale images. Bilevel grayscale images are treated similar to any
    other grayscale image unless CCITT FAX3/FAX4 compression is
    requested. Now allows the user to specify an arbitrary
    bits-per-sample value for grayscale images (even odd values) using
    "-define tiff:bits-per-sample=value". Now automatically stores the
    image as TrueColor RGB pixels if the image compression is set to JPEG.
    TIFF files are now written in using the TIFF library's default endian
    order rather than always big endian.
  * The WPG coder now renders embedded WMFs.
  * The PS3 coder is completely re-written to work much better and
    support more features (see ChangeLog).

Code structure enhancements:

  * Error handling has been improved and validated through testing.
    Some errors were being lost, unnecessarily ignored, or reported as
    something else entirely.
  * The number of error text messages to be maintained has been reduced
    by consolidating similar messages.
  * The memory allocator functions have been replaced with similar
    macros in order to eliminate warnings with GCC 3.3, avoid
    accidentally casting away const, and allow memory debuggers to
    report memory allocations and frees against the correct functions.
    The previously-used functions remain in the library for the purpose
    of compatibility.
  * <magick/xwindow.h> no longer depends on magick_config.h defines.
  * The text string localization code has been replaced with a simpler
    version written by Bill Radcliffe.
  * Added key,value "map" APIs (somewhat similar to C++'s <map>) for
    internal use.

API enhancements:

  * Incorporated John Cristy's Wand API's in a new GraphicsMagickWand
    library.
  * API definition is no longer dependent on types which vary in size
    (e.g. size_t) depending on large file compilation options.  This means
    that applications may now be compiled without any special large file
    options and still work properly with the library.
  * Thrown exceptions (ExceptionInfo structure) now include source
    file, source line, function name, and current system error number.
  * The GetMagickInfoArray() function is added to replace use of
    GetMagickInfo() for code which needs to access the coder list. This
    is necessary since invoking GetMagickInfo() may re-order the coder
    list, causing problems for code which traverses the list. Using
    GetMagickInfo() to access individual list elements is safe.
  * Added the CopyException function to support copying exception info
    from one structure to another.
  * Added the ReplaceImageInList function to replace an image in an
    image list.
  * Added the DrawPeekGraphicContext function to access the current
    DrawInfo structure in the drawing context stack. Use of this
    function is not recommended since it voilates proper programming
    practices. It is added to support the Wand API's.
  * GetImageDepth() now returns an integral value between 1 and
    QuantumDepth and is no longer limited to the values 8, 16, and 32.
  * SetImageDepth() supports setting the image modulus depth to any
    integral value between 1 and QuantumDepth. This effects the effective
    numeric precision, not the storage depth, since the quantum storage
    type is still a Quantum.
  * GetImageChannelDepth() supports retrieving the modulus depth for a
    specified channel.
  * SetImageChannelDepth() supports setting the modulus depth for a
    specified channel.
  * ProfileImage is updated to handle alpha channels and grayscale
    images.
  * Added GetImageProfile() to retrieve a CMS profile from an image.
  * Added SetImageProfile() to attach a CMS profile to an image without
    adjusting the image pixels.
  * Added DeleteImageProfile() to remove a CMS profile from an image.
  * ConstituteImage() and DispatchImage() now support 'T' (transparency),
    'O' (opacity), and 'P' (pad) options.
  * CompositeImage() now supports CopyCyanCompositeOp,
    CopyMagentaCompositeOp, CopyYellowCompositeOp, and
    CopyBlackCompositeOp, composition operators.
  * GetColorHistogram() obtains a color histogram for the image.
  * QuantumOperatorImage() and QuantumOperatorRegionImage() support
    arithmetic and bitwise operations on specified image channels.
  * The semaphore.h header is no longer installed or included in the
    API headers since these functions are private interfaces.
  * Configure using --enable-symbol-prefix or define
    PREFIX_MAGICK_SYMBOLS to use the C preprocessor to prefix all library
    symbols with "Gm". This prevents library symbol conflicts with other
    libraries.

PerlMagick fixes:

  * Adjusted a number of function option names so that they match the
    documentation.
  * Memory leak fixed.
  * Reading files (e.g. GIF) via a file descriptor is fixed.

Build improvements:

  * The TRIO library may be used to provide a replacement for vsnprintf
    if the C library doesn't provide it.  This improves security on old
    systems.
  * Configure only configures for C & C++ languages.
  * Configure now does a better job of figuring out how to build a
    thread-safe library across multiple operating systems.
  * Configure incorporates a new mmap() test which tests the
    functionality which is needed so that mmap() is not unnecessarily
    rejected on a number of systems. This improves performance for large
    files on those systems.
  * Configure/build fixes for IBM's AIX operating system.

Windows-specific improvements:

  * The static install package now uses the "uninstalled"
    configuration so that it does not depend on the Windows registry in
    order to run. This allows files from the static install package to
    be copied to another computer without running an installer.
  * The executable search path is extended at run-time to include the
    directory where the CORE DLLs reside in order to ensure that they
    are found.
  * Adding the -t option to VisualMagick configure enables building
    all of the coders into one library in order to save build time and
    simplify linkage.
  * The XTRN coder now supports wide characters.
  * LCMS library updated to version 1.10.
  * GMDisplay displays a checkerboard pattern behind transparent images.
  * Support is provided for issuing log messages to the Windows standard
    logging system.
  * Project files are now provided for use with Borland C++ Builder 6.0.
  * Updated LCMS version to 1.12.
  * Updated FreeType version to 2.1.5.
  * Updated JBIG-KIT to version 1.5.
  * Updated libpng to version 1.2.5.
  * Updated libwmf to version 0.2.8.2.
  * Updates zlib to version 1.2.1.
  * ActivePerl 5.8.1 Build 807 now supported.
  * GraphicsMagick now compiles using Visual Studio .NET 2003.

    "http://sourceforge.net/projects/graphicsmagick/".
  * CVSWeb via "http://cvs.graphicsmagick.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/".
  * CVS via cvs.graphicsmagick.org (find instructions at
    "http://www.graphicsmagick.org/CVS.html").
  * FTP via "ftp://ftp.graphicsmagick.org/pub/GraphicsMagick".

Project maintenance improvements:

  * ChangeLog conforms to the GNU standard and all CVS commits include
    useful log messages.
  * CVS commit messages posted to graphicsmagick-commit mail list.
  * CVS commit messages contain CVSWeb URL references.

Footprint changes from ImageMagick:

  * Library -lMagick renamed to -lGraphicsMagick.
  * Library -lMagick++ renamed to -lGraphicsMagick++.
  * Utilities consolidated into a single 'gm' utility (e.g. use 'gm
    convert').
  * Script Magick-config renamed to GraphicsMagick-config.
  * Script Magick++-config renamed to GraphicsMagick++-config.
  * Headers installed under ${PREFIX}/include/GraphicsMagick.
  * PerlMagick namespace renamed from "Image::Magick" to "Graphics::Magick".
  * Pkgconfig files GraphicsMagick.pc and GraphicsMagick++.pc are
    installed in $libdir/pkgconfig to assist pkg-config users.
  * Coder modules installed to lib/GraphicsMagick-1.0/modules-Q8/coders.
  * Filter modules installed to lib/GraphicsMagick-1.0/modules-Q8/filters.

Many performance enhancements:

  * Default QuantumDepth is 8 since this is adequate for most purposes
    and more efficient than 16.
  * The Magick++ demo (compiled with QuantumDepth=8 and -O2) runs about
    1.8X faster under SPARC/Solaris than the same demo with ImageMagick
    5.5.4.
  * Colorspace transformations are much faster.
  * Grayscale/monochrome image handling is much faster.
  * PseudoClass image handling is faster.
  * Text annotations using FreeType are much faster.
  * Image file I/O is much faster.
  * RLE-compressed MIFF reading much faster.

Code structure enhancements:

  * All utility support functions moved to magick/command.c in order to
    significantly reduce link dependencies, allowing statically-linked
    programs to be smaller.
  * Use of MogrifyImage() elminated except for by utilities.
  * Re-builds due to changes to <magick/image.h> reduced by splitting the
    header into multiple headers.
  * ISO C '99 typedefs (gm_int16_t, gm_uint16_t, gm_int32_t, gm_uint32_t,
    gm_int64_t, gm_uint64_t) are available for use.

Feature enhancements:

  * Module loader always enabled for shared builds to allow extension.
  * Loading of arbitrary filter modules (via -process option) supported
    under Unix as well as Windows.
  * SVG coder allows specifying size and initial background color.
  * JPEG-2000 coder (JP2) updated to work with Jasper 1.7.
  * HWB and HSL image colorspace translation support.
  * JNG/MNG/PNG format support tracks ImageMagick version.
  * BMP encoder can write 16-color indexed BMPs now as well as 2-color
    BMPs (not restricted to monochrome).
  * TIFF decoder now includes optimized support for tiled and stripped
    TIFF.
  * The -random-threshold option (RandomThresholdImage()) is added to
    threshold an image to bilevel using random thresholding.

Major bug fixes:

  * 100% successful test completion at all quantum depths (8/16/32).
  * A temporary file management subsystem is added to ensure that all
    temporary files are removed before program exit. Temporary files are
    created and used in a secure fashion to avoid the possibility that a
    "trojan" temporary file (e.g. a symbolic link, or a file containing
    unsafe content) is created before a delegate has the chance to write
    to it. The environment variable MAGICK_TMPDIR allows the user to
    specify where temporary files are created without altering where
    other programs create their temporary files. Temporary filenames are
    created in 8+3 format to hopefully be more acceptable to ralcgm.
  * When dithering is disabled, don't dither when converting to a
    PseudoClass, grayscale, or monochrome image. Disabling dithering
    may cause these translations to be much faster.
  * PICON format works with BLOBs.
  * No longer removes input file when pinging a FlashPIX file.
  * Arc drawing and texture fill fixes from ImageMagick.
  * Sample, scale and affine fixes from ImageMagick.
  * MIFF colormaps are now scaled properly while reading.
  * CMYK translation works for QuantumDepth=32.
  * ConstituteImage now works properly for grayscale images.
  * Built-in tilde expansion and filename globbing now works properly.
  * InitializeMagick now registers signal handlers to ensure that
    resources are released before program exit.  This helps avoid
    temporary file leaks due to the user using "CONTROL-C".
  * The installed <magick/magick_config.h> header now only contains
    the few definitions required by the API headers.  This should
    significantly reduce or eliminate conflicts with other package
    headers.

Windows platform enhancements:

  * Configure updated for Visual C++ 7.0.
  * OLE object (ImageMagickObject) re-written to work with Visual C++ 7.0
  * New function, CropImageToHBITMAP(), to return a region of the image
    as a Windows HBITMAP.
  * Use vsnprintf to format strings under Windows (safer).

On November 19, 2002, GraphicsMagick was created as a fork of
ImageMagick, several days before the ImageMagick 5.5.2 release.

The objectives of GraphicsMagick are to:

  * Use an open development model.
  * Encourage new developers to join the project.
  * Avoid unnecessary source code "churn".
  * Establish and preserve a stable API.
  * Use efficient coding practices which result in fast code.
  * Improve memory efficiency.
  * Use a release process which assures a working product.
  * Maintain an accurate ChangeLog.
