<p>
  Use 'configure' to automatically configure, build, and install
  GraphicsMagick. The configure script may be executed from the GraphicsMagick
  source directory (e.g ./configure) or from a seperate build directory by
  specifying the full path to configure (e.g.
  /src/GraphicsMagick-1.0.0/configure). The advantage of using a seperate
  build directory is that multiple GraphicsMagick builds may share the same
  GraphicsMagick source directory while allowing each build to use a unique
  set of options.

<p>
  If you are willing to accept configure's default options, and build from
  within the source directory, type:

<p>
      ./configure

<p>
  and watch the configure script output to verify that it finds everything
  that you think it should. If it does not, then adjust your environment
  so that it does.

<p>
  By default, `make install' will install the package's files
  in `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc. You can specify an
  installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure'
  the option `--prefix=PATH'.  This is valuable in case you don't have
  privileges to install under the default paths or if you want to install
  in the system directories instead.

<p>
  If you are not happy with configure's choice of compiler, compilation
  flags, or libraries, you can give `configure' initial values for
  variables by specifying them on the configure command line, e.g.:

<p>
      ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix

<p>
  Options which should be common to packages installed under the same
  directory heirarchy may be supplied via a 'config.site' file located
  under the installation prefix via the path ${prefix}/share/config.site
  where ${prefix} is the installation prefix.  This file is used for all
  packages installed under that prefix.  This is an example config.site
  file:

<p>
  # Configuration values for all packages installed under this prefix
  CC=gcc<BR>
  CXX=c++<BR>
  CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include'<BR>
  LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib'

<p>
  When the 'config.site' file is being used to supply configuration
  options, configure will issue a message similar to:

<p>
    configure: loading site script /usr/local/share/config.site

<p>
  The configure variables you should be aware of are:

<PRE>
      CC          Name of C compiler (e.g. 'cc -Xa') to use
      CXX         Name of C++ compiler to use (e.g. 'CC')
      CFLAGS      Compiler flags (e.g. '-g -O2') to compile C code
      CXXFLAGS    Compiler flags (e.g. '-g -O2') to compile C++ code
      CPPFLAGS    Include paths (-I/somedir) to look for header files
      LDFLAGS     Library paths (-L/somedir) to look for libraries
                  Systems that support the notion of a library run-path
                  may require an additional argument in order to find
                  shared libraries at run time. For example, the Solaris
                  linker requires an argument of the form '-R/somedir',
                  some Linux systems will work with '-rpath /somedir',
                  while some other Linux systems who's gcc does not pass
                  -rpath to the linker require an argument of the form
                  '-Wl,-rpath,/somedir'.
      LIBS        Extra libraries (-lsomelib) required to link
</PRE>

<p>
  Any variable (e.g. CPPFLAGS or LDFLAGS) which requires a directory
  path must specify an absolute path rather than a relative path.

<p>
  Configure can usually find the X include and library files
  automatically, but if it doesn't, you can use the `configure' options
  `--x-includes=DIR' and `--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

<p>
  The configure script provides a number of GraphicsMagick specific
  options.  When disabling an option --disable-something is equivalent to
  specifying --enable-something=no and --without-something is equivalent
  to --with-something=no.  The configure options are as
  follows (execute 'configure --help' to see all options).

</PRE>

<p>
  GraphicsMagick options represent either features to be enabled, disabled,
  or packages to be included in the build.  When a feature is enabled (via
  --enable-something), it enables code already present in GraphicsMagick.
  When a package is enabled (via --with-something), the configure script
  will search for it, and if is is properly installed and ready to use
  (headers and built libraries are found by compiler) it will be included
  in the build.  The configure script is delivered with all features
  disabled and all packages enabled. In general, the only reason to
  disable a package is if a package exists but it is unsuitable for the
  build (perhaps an old version or not compiled with
  the right compilation flags).

<p>
  Several configure options require special note:

<UL>
  <LI> --enable-shared: the shared libraries are built. Shared
      libraries are preferred because they allow programs to share
      common code, making the individual programs much smaller. In
      addition shared libraries are required in order for PerlMagick to
      be dynamically loaded by an installed PERL (otherwise an additional
      PERL (PerlMagick) must be installed. This option is not the default
      because all libraries used by GraphicsMagick must also be dynamic
      libraries if GraphicsMagick itself is to be dynamically loaded (such
      as for PerlMagick).

</UL>
<PRE>
      GraphicsMagick built with delegates (see MAGICK PLUG-INS below) can
      pose additional challenges. If GraphicsMagick is built using static
      libraries (the default without --enable-shared) then delegate
      libraries may be built as either static libraries or shared
      libraries. However, if GraphicsMagick is built using shared libraries,
      then all delegate libraries must also be built as shared libraries.
      Static libraries usually have the extension .a, while shared
      libraries typically have extensions like .so, .sa, or .dll. Code in
      shared libraries normally must compiled using a special compiler
      option to produce Position Independent Code (PIC). The only time
      this is not necessary is if the platform compiles code as PIC by
      default.

      PIC compilation flags differ from vendor to vendor (gcc's is
      -fPIC). However, you must compile all shared library source with
      the same flag (for gcc use -fPIC rather than -fpic). While static
      libraries are normally created using an archive tool like 'ar',
      shared libraries are built using special linker or compiler
      options (e.g. -shared for gcc).

      Building shared libraries often requires subtantial hand-editing of
      Makefiles and is only recommended for those who know what they are
      doing.

      If --enable-shared is not specified, a new PERL interpreter
      (PerlMagick) is built which is statically linked against the
      PerlMagick extension. This new interpreter is installed into the
      same directory as the GraphicsMagick utilities. If --enable-shared
      is specified, the PerlMagick extension is built as a dynamically
      loadable object which is loaded into your current PERL interpreter
      at run-time. Use of dynamically-loaded extensions is preferable over
      statically linked extensions so --enable-shared should be specified
      if possible (note that all libraries used with GraphicsMagick must
      be shared libraries!).
</PRE>

<UL>
  <LI> --disable-static: static archive libraries (with extension .a)
      are not built.  If you are building shared libraries, there
      is little value to building static libraries. Reasons to build
      static libraries include: 1) they can be easier to debug; 2) the
      clients do not have external dependencies (i.e. libMagick.so); 3)
      building PIC versions of the delegate libraries may take additional
      expertise and effort; 4) you are unable to build shared libraries.

  <LI> --with-modules: image format coders are built as loadable modules
      which are installed in [prefix]/lib/GraphicsMagick/modules/coders.
      Support for modules allows the formats supported by GraphicsMagick
      to be extended by simply adding additional modules to the module
      search path.  The modules option is only available in conjunction
      with --enable-shared.  If --enable-shared is not also specified,
      then support for modules is disabled.

  <LI> --enable-lzw: Unisys claims a patent on the algorithm supporting
      LZW compression (e.g. used by GIF and TIFF). To avoid possibly
      infringing on this patent, support for LZW is disabled by default.
      With LZW support, GIF files written by GraphicsMagick will be much
      larger than expected. Note that the TIFF library must be patched in
      order to support LZW compression, and that this support must be
      explicitly enabled in the libtiff Makefiles.

  <LI> --disable-16bit-pixel: By default GraphicsMagick represents images
      internally using a sixteen-bit pixel quantum (the size of the
      red, green, blue, and alpha pixel components). The definition
      QuantumDepth=8 is applied when GraphicsMagick is built, allowing
      RGBA values to range from 0 to 255 rather than 0 to 65535. Use
      of sixteen-bit pixel quantums typically causes GraphicsMagick to run
      about 30% slower (and take twice as much memory) than when it is
      built to support eight-bit pixel quantums. Those who value
      performance over accuracy may specify --disable-16bit-pixel.

  <LI> --without-magick-plus-plus: Disable building Magick++, the C++
      application programming interface to GraphicsMagick. A suitable C++
      compiler is required in order to build Magick++. Specify the CXX
      configure variable to select the C++ compiler to use (default
      "g++"), and CXXFLAGS to select the desired compiler opimization
      and debug flags (default "-g -O2"). Antique C++ compilers will
      normally be rejected by configure tests so specifying this option
      should only be necessary if Magick++ fails to compile.

  <LI> --without-frozenpaths: Normally full paths to external programs
      (based on searching the PATH set when configure is run) will be
      saved to the delegates.mgk file. Specify this option to disable
      saving full paths to programs.

  <LI> --without-threads: By default, the GraphicsMagick library is compiled
      with multi-thread support.  If this is undesireable, then specify
      --without-threads.

  <LI> --with-cache: Specify a different image pixel cache threshold
      using the --with-cache option. When GraphicsMagick will have more image
      pixel data in memory than the cache threshold setting, additional
      images are cached on disk. Since memory is much faster than disk,
      it is usually better to use memory rather than disk for the pixel
      cache. The default cache threshold is 2047MB.  Small memory machines
      may want to decrease the threshold.

  <LI> --disable-largefile: By default, GraphicsMagick is compiled with
      support for large (&gt; 2GB on a 32-bit CPU) files if the operating
      system supports large files.  All applications which use the
      GraphicsMagick library must then also include support for large
      files. By disabling support for large files via --disable-largefile,
      dependent applications do not require special compilation options
      for large files in order to use the library.

  <LI> --without-perl: By default, PerlMagick is conveniently compiled
      and installed as part of GraphicsMagick's normal "configure", "make",
      "make install" process.. When --without-perl is specified, you must
      first install GraphicsMagick, change to the PerlMagick subdirectory,
      build, and finally install PerlMagick. Note, PerlMagick is
      configured even if --without-perl is specified. If the argument
      --with-perl=/path/to/perl is supplied, then /path/to/perl will be
      taken as the PERL interpreter to use. This is important in case the
      'perl' executable in your PATH is not PERL5, or is not the PERL
      you want to use.

  <LI> --with-perl-options: The PerlMagick module is normally installed
      using the Perl interpreter's installation PREFIX, rather than
      GraphicsMagick's. If GraphicsMagick's installation prefix is not
      the same as PERL's PREFIX, then you may find that PerlMagick's
      'make install' step tries to install into a directory tree that
      you don't have write permissions to. This is common when PERL is
      delivered with the operating system or on Internet Service Provider
      (ISP) web servers. If you want PerlMagick to install elsewhere,
      then provide a PREFIX option to PERL's configuration step via
      "--with-perl-options=PREFIX=/some/place". Other options
      accepted by MakeMaker are 'LIB', 'LIBPERL_A', 'LINKTYPE', and
      'OPTIMIZE'. See the ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3) manual page for more
      information on configuring PERL extensions.

  <LI> --without-x: By default, GraphicsMagick will use X11 libraries if
      they are available. When --without-x is specified, use of X11 is
      disabled. The display, animate, and import programs are not built
      or installed. The remaining programs have reduced functionality
      such as no access to X11 fonts (consider using Postscript or
      TrueType fonts instead).

  <LI> --with-gs-font-dir: Specify the directory containing the
      Ghostscript Postscript Type 1 font files (e.g. "n022003l.pfb") so
      that they can be rendered using the FreeType library. If the font
      files are installed using the default Ghostscript installation paths
      (${prefix}/share/ghostscript/fonts), they should be discovered
      automatically by configure and specifying this option is not
      necessary. Specify this option if the Ghostscript fonts fail to
      be located automatically, or the location needs to be overridden.

  <LI> --with-windows-font-dir: If configured under a Unix emulation
      environment like Cygwin configure should automatically locate the
      MS-Windows system font directory. If configure is not running
      under MS-Windows yet MS-Windows-compatible fonts are available
      use --with-windows-font-dir=/path to specify the directory where
      the fonts are installed.

</UL>
<p>
  Building under Cygwin

<p>
    GraphicsMagick may be built under the Windows '95-XP Cygwin
    Unix-emulation environment available for free from

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">
http://www.cygwin.com/</a><br>

<p>
    X11R6 for Cygwin is available from

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://xfree86.cygwin.com/">
http://xfree86.cygwin.com/</a><br>

<p>
    It is strongly recommended that the
    X11R6 package be installed since this enables GraphicsMagick's X11
    support (animate, display, and import will work) and it includes the
    Freetype v2 DLL required to support TrueType and Postscript Type 1
    fonts. Make sure that /usr/X11R6/bin is in your PATH prior to running
    configure. If you are using Cygwin version 1.3.9 or later, you may
    specify the configure option '--enable-shared' to build Cygwin DLLs.
    Specifying '--enable-shared' is required if you want to build
    PerlMagick under Cygwin because Cygwin does not provide the libperl.a
    static library required to create a static PerlMagick.

<p>
  Building under MinGW &amp; MSYS

<p>
    GraphicsMagick may be built using the free MinGW ("Minimalistic GNU for
    Windows") package version 1.1, available from

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mingw.org">
http://www.mingw.org</a><br>

<p>
    which consists of a GNU-based (e.g. gcc) compilation toolset plus
    headers and libraries required to build programs which are entirely
    based on standard Microsoft Windows DLLs. MSYS provides a Unix-like
    console shell window with sufficient functionality to run the
    GraphicsMagick configure script and execute make.

<p>
    Unlike the Cygwin build which creates programs based on a
    Unix-emulation DLL, and which uses Unix-style paths to access
    Windows files, the MinGW build creates native Windows console
    applications similar to the Visual C++ build.

<p>
    Please note that since the MinGW build is very new, some aspects of
    the installation may vary from Windows user's expectations, and that
    only a static build (no DLLs or modules) is currently supported.

<p>
    Once MinGW &amp; MSYS have been installed, start the MSYS console (via
    the MSYS icon on the Windows desktop) and follow the Unix configure
    and build instructions. Note that the default installation prefix is
    "/usr/local" which installs the package into a MSYS directory. To
    install outside of the MSYS directory tree, you may specify an
    installation prefix like "/c/GraphicsMagick" which causes the package
    to be installed under the Windows directory "C:\GraphicsMagick". The
    installation directory structure will look very much like the Unix
    installation layout (e.g. "C:\GraphicsMagick\bin",
    "C:\GraphicsMagick\lib", "C:\GraphicsMagick\share", etc.). Any additional
    delegate libraries (e.g. libpng) will need to be built under MinGW
    in order to be used.

<p>
  Dealing with configuration failures:

<p>
    While configure is designed to ease installation of GraphicsMagick, it
    often discovers problems that would otherwise be encountered later
    when compiling GraphicsMagick. The configure script tests for headers
    and libraries by executing the compiler (CC) with the specified
    compilation flags (CFLAGS), pre-processor flags (CPPFLAGS), and linker
    flags (LDFLAGS). Any errors are logged to the file 'config.log'. If
    configure fails to discover a header or library please review this
    log file to determine why, however, please be aware that *errors
    in the config.log are normal* because configure works by trying
    something and seeing if it fails. An error in config.log is only a
    problem if the test should have passed on your system. After taking
    corrective action, be sure to remove the 'config.cache' file before
    running configure so that configure will re-inspect the environment
    rather than using cached values.

<p>
    Common causes of configure failures are: 1) a delegate header is
    not in the header include path (CPPFLAGS -I option); 2) a delegate
    library is not in the linker search/run path (LDFLAGS -L/-R option);
    3) a delegate library is missing a function (old version?); 4)
    compilation environment is faulty.

<p>
    If all reasonable corrective actions have been tried and the
    problem appears to be due to a flaw in the configure script,
    please send a bug report to the configure script maintainer
    (currently bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us). All bug reports should
    contain the operating system type (as reported by 'uname -a')
    and the compiler/compiler-version. A copy of the configure script
    output and/or the config.log file may be valuable in order to find
    the problem. If you send a config.log, please also send a script of
    the configure output and a description of what you expected to see
    (and why) so the failure you are observing can be identified and
    resolved.

<p>
  Makefile Build Targets

<p>
    Once GraphicsMagick is configured, these standard build targets are
    available from the generated Makefiles:

<PRE>
       'make'
          Build the package

       'make install'
          Install the package

       'make check'
          Run tests using the installed GraphicsMagick ('make install' must
          be done first!).

       'make clean'
          Remove everything in the build directory created by 'make'

       'make distclean'
          Remove everything in the build directory created by 'configure'
          and 'make'. This is useful if you want to start over from scratch.

       'make uninstall'
        Remove all files from the system which are (or would be)
        installed by 'make install' using the current configuration.
          Note that this target is imperfect for PerlMagick since Perl
          no longer supports an 'uninstall' target.
</PRE>

<p>
  Build &amp; Install:

<p>
    Now that GraphicsMagick is configured, type

<p>
       make

<p>
    to build the package and

<p>
       make install

<p>
    to install it.

<p>
  Verifying The Build:

<p>
    To confirm your installation of the GraphicsMagick distribution was
    successful, type:

<p>
        ./utilities/display

<p>
    The GraphicsMagick logo is displayed.

<p>
    If the image colors are not correct use this command:

<p>
        ./utilities/display -visual default

<p>
    For a more serious test, you may run the GraphicsMagick test suite by
    typing

<p>
        make check

<p>
    Note that due to differences between the developer's environment and
    your own it is possible that some tests may be indicated as failed
    even though the results are ok. Differences between the developer's
    environment environment and your own may include the compiler, the
    CPU type, and the library versions used. The GraphicsMagick developers
    use the current release of all dependent libraries.

<p>
  Documentation:

<p>
    Be sure to read the manual pages for the display(1), animate(1),
    montage(1), import(1), mogrify(1), identify(1), composite(1), and
    convert(1) utilities. The GraphicsMagick(1) manual page provides details
    for utility options and will also aid with understanding library
    interfaces. Also read the GraphicsMagick frequently asked questions in
    the file www/Magick.html.

<p>
  X11 Resources:

<p>
    Place display(1) X application defaults in
    /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Display or in a directory specified by the
    XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable. Use the appropriate name
    for other clients (e.g. Animate, Montage, etc). To execute display(1)
    from as a menu item of any window manager (olwm, mwm, twm, etc), use

<p>
       display logo:Untitled

<PRE>
      to read the Postscript or the Portable Document format. It is used
      to annotate an image when the FreeType library is not used, or an
      X server is not available. See the FreeType library above for
      another means to annotate an image. Note, Ghostscript must support
      the ppmraw device (type gs -h to verify). If Ghostscript is
      unavailable, the Display Postscript extension is used to rasterize
      a Postscript document (assuming you define HasDPS). The DPS
      extension is less robust than Ghostscript in that it will only
      rasterize one page of a multi-page document.

      Ghostscript (released 7.0 and later) may optionally install a
      library (libgs). If this library is installed, GraphicsMagick will
      attempt to use it unless the option --without-gslib is passed to
      configure. Note that Ghostscript provides its own modified version
      of libjpeg and that symbols from this libjpeg may be confused with
      symbols with the stand-alone libjpeg. If conflicts cause JPEG to
      fail, it may be necessary to use Ghostscript's copy of libjpeg for
      GraphicsMagick, and all delegate libraries which depend on libjpeg.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/wvware/</a><br>

<PRE>
      to render files in the Windows Meta File (WMF) metafile format
      (16-bit WMF files only, not 32-bit "EMF"). This is the format
      commonly used for Windows clipart (available on CD at your local
      computer or technical book store). WMF support requires the
      FreeType 2 library in order to render TrueType and Postscript fonts.

      While GraphicsMagick uses the libwmflite (parser) component of the
      libwmf package which does not depend on any special libraries, the
      libwmf package as a whole depends on FreeType 2 and either the
      xmlsoft libxml, or expat libraries. Since GraphicsMagick already uses
      libxml (for reading SVG and to retrieve files via HTTP or FTP), it
      is recommended that the options '--without-expat --with-xml' be
      supplied to libwmf's configure script.

      GraphicsMagick's WMF renderer provides some of the finest WMF
      rendering available due its use of antialiased drawing algorithms.
      You may select a background color or texture image to render on.
      For example, "-background '#ffffffff'" renders on a transparent
      background while "-texture plasma:fractal" renders on a fractal
      image.

      A set of Windows 3.1 compatible TrueType fonts (Arial, Times New
      Roman, and Courier New) may be downloaded without charge from
      Microsoft's web site via the URL

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm">
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm</a><br>

      The WMF renderer is not capable of using Windows fonts with libwmf
      0.2.2. Windows fonts are fully supported when using libwmf 0.2.5
      or later.

<p>
Windows Win2K/95 VISUAL C++ 6.0 COMPILATION

<p>
  The Visual C++ distribution targeted at Windows Win2K or Windows 95
  does not provide any stock workspace (DSW) or project files (DSP)
  except for those included with third party libraries. Instead, there
  is a "configure" program that must be built and run that creates an
  environment that meets your particular needs.

<p>
  The issue with the Visual C++ working environment is that there are
  a fairly large number of mutually exclusive options that must all be
  used in a coherent manner, or problems result.

<p>
  The Visual C++ system provides three different types of "runtimes"
  that must match across all application, library, and DLL code that is
  built. The "configure" program creates a set of build files that are
  consistent for a specific runtime selection.

<p>
  The three options for runtime support are:

<OL>
  <LI> Dynamic Multi-threaded DLL runtimes.
  <LI> Static Single-threaded runtimes
  <LI> Static Multi-threaded runtimes
  <LI> Static Multi-threaded DLL runtimes

</OL>
<p>
  In addition to these runtimes, the VisualMagick build environment allows
  you to select whether to include the X11 libraries in the build or use
  the X11 "stubs". The assumption is that most Win32 user could care
  less about X11 support, so we stub out all the X11 functionality so
  that everything compiles. However, the X11 utility programs animate,
  display, and import will not work.

<p>
  This leads to five different possible build options, which should
  cover almost any particular situation. The default binary distribution
  is built using #1 from above with the X11 libraries included. This
  results in an X11 compatible build using all DLL's for everything and
  multi-threaded support (the only option for DLL's).

<p>
  To do a build for your requirements, simply go to the configure subdirectory 
  under VisualMagick and open the configure.dsw workspace.
  Set the build configuration to "Release" under the

<p>
      "Build..., Set Active Configuration..."  menu.

<p>
  Build and execute the configure program and follow the instructions.
  You should probably not change any of the defaults unless you have a
  specific reason to do so.

<p>
  After creating your build environment you can proceed to open the DSW
  file that was generated and build everything from there.

<p>
  In the final DSW file you will find a project call "All". In order to
  build everything in the distribution, select this project and make it
  the "active" project. Set the build configuration to the desired one
  (Debug, or Release) and do a "clean" followed by a "build". You should
  do the build in a specific way:

<OL>
  <LI> Make the "All" project the active project (Bold)
       Right click on the All project and select "Set As Active Project"
  <LI> Select "Build..., Clean"
  <LI> Select "Build..., Build"
  <LI> Go get some coffee unless you have a very fast machine!.

</OL>
<p>
  The "Clean" step is needed in order to make sure that all of the target
  support libraries are updated with any patches needed to get them to
  compile properly under Visual C++.

<p>
  All of the required files that are needed to run any of the command
  line tools will be found in the "bin" subdirectory of the VisualMagick
  subdirectory. This includes EXE, and DLL files. You should be able
  to test the build directly from this directory without having to move
  anything to any of the global SYSTEM or SYSTEM32 areas in the operating
  system installation.

<p>
<STRONG>NOTE #1:</STRONG>

<p>
  The Visual C++ distribution of GraphicsMagick comes with the Magick++
  C++ wrapper by default. This add-on layer has a large number of demo
  and test files that can be found in GraphicsMagick\Magick++\demo, and
  GraphicsMagick\Magick++\tests. There are also a variety of tests that
  use the straight C API as well in GraphicsMagick\tests.

<p>
  All of these programs are NOT configured to be built in the default
  workspace created by the configure program. You can cause all of these
  demos and test programs to be built by checking the box in configure
  that says:

<p>
    "Include all demo and test programs"

<p>
  In addition, there is another related checkbox (checked by default)
  that causes all generate project files to be created standalone so
  that they can be copied to other areas of you system.

<p>
  This is the checkbox:

<p>
   "Generate all utility projects with full paths rather then relative
    paths"

<p>
  WOW - that a mouthfull - eh?

<p>
  The problem is that Visual C++ uses a concept of "dependencies" that
  tell it what other things need to be build when a particular project
  is being build. This mechanism is also used to cause things to link
  properly. In my normal development environment, I want to be able to
  make changes and debug the system as a whole, so I like and NEED to
  use dependencies. However, most end users don't want to work this way.

<p>
  Instead they really just want to build the package and then get down
  to business working on their application. The solution is to make all
  the utility projects (UTIL_xxxx_yy_exe.dsp) use full absolute paths
  to all the things they need. This way the projects stand on their own
  and can actually be copied and used as templates to get a particular
  custom application compiling with little effort.

<p>
  With this feature enabled, you should be able to nab a copy of...

<p>
    VisualMagick\utilities\UTIL_convert_xxx_exe.dsp  (for C)

<p>
     -or-

<p>
    VisualMagick\Magick++\demo\UTIL_demo_xxx_exe.dsp (for C++)

<p>
  ... and pop it into notepad, modify it (carefully) to your needs and
  be on your way to happy compiling and linking.

<p>
  You can feel free to pick any of the standard utilities, tests, or
  demo programs as the basis for a new program by copying the project
  and the source and hacking away.

<p>
  The choice of what to use as a starting point is very easy...

<p>
  For straight C API command line applications use something from:

<p>
    GraphicsMagick\tests or GraphicsMagick\utilities (source code)
    GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\tests or GraphicsMagick\Visualmagick\utilities
      (project - DSP)

<p>
  For C++ and Magick++ command line applications use something from:

<p>
    GraphicsMagick\Magick++\tests or GraphicsMagick\Magick++\demo
      (source code)<BR>
    GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\Magick++\tests or
      GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\Magick++\demo (project - DSP)

<p>
  For C++ and Magick++ and MFC windows applications use:

<p>
    GraphicsMagick\contrib\win32\MFC\NtMagick (source code)
    GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\contrib\win32\MFC\NtMagick
      (project - DSP)

<p>
<STRONG>NOTE #2:</STRONG>

<p>
  The GraphicsMagick distribution is very modular. The default
  configuration is there to get you rolling, but you need to make some
  serious choices when you wish to change things around.

<p>
  The binary distribution and default options are all targeted at
  having all the components in one place - the "bin" directory of the
  VisualMagick build tree AND the C:\GraphicsMagick folder.

<p>
  The C:\GraphicsMagick folder should contain the following files:

<OL>
  <LI> magic.mgk
  <LI> delegates.mgk (derived from nt.mgk)
  <LI> modules.mgk
  <LI> rgb.txt

</OL>
<p>
  The "bin" folder should contains all EXE's and DLL's as well as the
  very important "modules.mgk" file.

<p>
  With this default setup, you can use any of the command line tools
  and run scripts as normal. You can actually get by quite nicely this
  way by doing something like "pushd e:\xxx\yyy\bin" in any scripts you
  write to execute "out of" this directory.

<p>
  ALSO, By default the core of GraphicsMagick on Win32 always looks in the
  place were the exe program is run from in order to find all of the
  files as well as the DLL's it needs.

<p>
  Of course - all of this is configurable and there are certain
  environment variables and compiler switches that allow you to do
  whatever you want. Some of these are Windows things and the rest are
  looked at by the core GraphicsMagick code.

<p>
<STRONG>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:</STRONG>

<p>
  You can use the "System" control panel to allow you to add and delete
  what is in any of the environment variables. You can even have user
  specific environment variables if you wish.

<p>
<STRONG>PATH</STRONG>

<p>
   This sets the default list of places were Windows looks for EXE's and
   DLL's. Windows CMD shell seems to look in the "current" directory first
<UL>
  <LI> no matter what, so that is why you really don't have to muck. If
   you wish to run any of utilities from another location then you must
   add the path to your "bin" directory in. For instance, you might add:

</UL>
<p>
      D:\CVS\GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\bin

<p>
   to do this for the default build environment like I do.  One slight
   problem with this is that fact that Windows has another program called
   "convert". I usually rename this to something else since it is only
   used to convert disks from FAT to NTFS.

<p>
<STRONG>MAGICK_HOME</STRONG>

<p>
   If all you do is modify the PATH variable, the first problem you
   will run into is that GraphicsMagick may not be able to find any of
   its "modules. Modules are all the IM_MOD*.DLL files you see in the
   distribution. There is one of these for each and every file format
   that GraphicsMagick supports. This environment variable tells the system
   were to look for these DLL's. The compiled in "default" is "execution
   path" - which says - look in the same place that the application is
   running "in". If you are running from somewhere other then "bin" -
   this will no longer work and you must use this variable. If you elect
   to leave the modules in the same place as the EXE's (a good idea)
   then you can simply set this to the same place
   as you did the PATH variable. In my case:

<p>
      D:\\GraphicsMagick\coders

<p>
   This is also the place were GraphicsMagick expects to find the
   "colors.mgk", "delegates.mgk", "magic.mgk", "modules.mgk", and
   "type.mgk" files.

<p>
   One cool thing about the modules build of GraphicsMagick is that you can
   now leave out file formats and lighten you load. If all you ever need
   is GIF and JPEG, then simply drop all the other DLL's into the local
   trash can and get on with your life.

<p>
   WARNING: Always keep the "xc" format, since IM seems to need and
   "assume" that this one exists and gets real "unhappy" if it does
   not. We are still tracking down some of these issues.

<p>
  ALSO. You can elect to changes these things the good old "hard-coded"
  way. Two #defines are applicable.

<p>
  defines.h has

<p>
      #define MagickConfigurePath  "c:\\GraphicsMagick\\"

<p>
<STRONG>NOTE #3:</STRONG>

<p>
  The two utilities "display" and "animate" will only be usable when
  the real X11 libraries are included. The other build environments
  uses the X11 stubs to supply non-functional stubs for the X-Window
  functionality. There is no support for a "static" build of the X11
  support because the build procedures for the X11 libraries do not seem
  to support this.

<p>
  To view any image in a Microsoft window, type

<p>
      convert image.ext win:

<p>
  Make sure gswin32 (Ghostscript) is in your execution path (see
  Autoexec.bat), otherwise, you will be unable to convert or view a
  Postscript document.

<p>
  Make sure iexplore (Internet Explorer) is in your execution path (see
  Autoexec.bat), otherwise, you will be unable to browse the GraphicsMagick
  documentation.

<p>
  The Win2K executables will work under Windows 95/98.


<p>
<STRONG>MACINTOSH COMPILATION</STRONG>

<p>
  The Macintosh distribution contains MetroWerks Codewarrior Professional
  projects for compilation.  For those who do not have access to
  CodeWarrior, the binaries for the command line utilities are enclosed.
  I had to comment the inline intrinsic functions in math.h in order
  to compile.  If you have a better solution, let me know.

<p>
  Display(1), animate(1), and import(1) currently do not work on the
  Macintosh.


<p>
Magick++

<p>
  Magick++ provides a straightforward C++ language API to GraphicsMagick.
  Magick++ is built by default under the Unix, Windows, and Mac build
  environments. To disable building Magick++ under Unix, specify
  --without-magick-plus-plus as an argument to the configure script.

<p>
  Magick++ is currently supported using the following C++ compilers:

<p>
    egcs 1.1.2 (or later)<BR>
    gcc 2.95.2 (or later)<BR>
    Visual C++ 6.0 (Windows)<BR>
    IRIX C++ 7.3.1.1m<BR>
    HP-UX HP-UX aCC A.03.30<BR>
    Sun Workshop 5.0 C++ (tests/demos require work-around to build)
    Sun Forte 6.0 C++<BR>
    CodeWarrior Professional Release 5 (Macintosh)

<p>
  and may compile under other modern C++ compilers as well.
