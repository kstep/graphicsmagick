<H4 CLASS="western">Prerequisites</H4>
<P CLASS="western">While multiple versions of GraphicsMagick may be
installed at one time, if your intention is to replace a prior
installation of GraphicsMagick with a newer version, then it may be
wise to uninstall the existing GraphicsMagick (see uninstall
procedure) prior to installing the newer version.<BR><BR>While it is
not a requirement, it is strongly recommended that the <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript</A>
package (version 7.05 preferred since it has the least bugs) be
installed. GraphicsMagick uses Ghostscript to render Postscript and
PDF files, as well as formats where a translator to Postscript is
available. GraphicsMagick will also use the fonts delivered with
Ghostscript to support the standard set of Adobe Postscript fonts
like &quot;Helvetica&quot; and &quot;Times Roman&quot;. <BR><BR>The
installation package includes the GraphicsMagick Perl extension (
<A HREF="perl.html">PerlMagick</A>) as an installation option. If you
would like to use this extension, then you must install <A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/Download.html">ActiveState
ActivePerl</A> prior to commencing with installation of
GraphicsMagick. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Retrieve Install Package</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Retrieve the GraphicsMagick Windows binary install
package from a one of the ftp sites listed at the <A HREF="download.html">GraphicsMagick
Download Sites</A> page. The available install packages are as
follows</P>
<P CLASS="western">Windows Dynamic-Multithread (DLL-based) install
package with utilities, PerlMagick, ImageMagickObject COM object, API
headers, DLLs, link libraries, and web pages.</P>
<PRE>    GraphicsMagick-1.0.5-Q8-windows-dll.exe
    GraphicsMagick-1.0.5-Q16-windows-dll.exe</PRE><P CLASS="western">
Windows Static-Multithread package including the utilities (gm.exe,
gmdisplay.exe, and MagickCMD.exe), the <A HREF="ImageMagickObject.html">ImageMagickObject</A>
COM object, and the GraphicsMagick web pages. This package does not
include PerlMagick.</P>
<PRE>    GraphicsMagick-1.0.5-Q8-windows-static.exe
    GraphicsMagick-1.0.5-Q16-windows-static.exe</PRE><P CLASS="western">
Note that the QuantumDepth=8 version (Q8) which provides industry
standard 24/32 bit pixels consumes half the memory and about 30% less
CPU than the QuantumDepth=16 version (Q16) which provides 48/64 bit
pixels for high-resolution color. A Q8 version is fine for processing
typical photos. If you are dealing with scientific or medical images
or deal with images that have limited contrast, then the Q16 version
is recommended. It is also possible to build a Q32 version which has
enough resolution to deal with the latest reconnaissance images.
Please let us know if there is any demand for the Q32 versions.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Start Installation Wizard 
</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Execute the downloaded file from your browser or
by double-clicking on the filename from within Windows Explorer. The
GraphicsMagick Setup Wizard will appear. Click on &ldquo;Next&gt;&rdquo;
to continue. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Read Installation Information</H4>
<P CLASS="western">An informational screen is presented which
provides a summary of things you should know before you proceed.
Please take care to read this information. Once you have finished,
Click on &ldquo;Next&gt;&rdquo; to continue. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Select Destination Directory</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Specify what drive and directory to install
GraphicsMagick into. Approximately 15MB of free disk space is
required to install all of GraphicsMagick (you may choose to install
a subset to save space). A message at the bottom of the screen will
tell you exactly how much space is required to install the complete
package. The default installation directory is similar to &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Cumberland">C:\Program
Files\GraphicsMagick-1.0.5-Q8</FONT>&rdquo;. Once you have entered
the desired installation directory, then select &ldquo;Next&gt;&rdquo;
to continue. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Select Start Menu Folder</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Select the folder where you would like the
program's shortcuts to appear. The default should normally be
satisfactory. Click on &ldquo;Next&gt;&rdquo; to continue. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Select Additional Tasks</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A screen is displayed which presents most (or all)
of the following options:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in">Create a desktop
	icon</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in">Update

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1in">Install
	ImageMagickObject OLE Control for VBscript, Visual Basic, and WSH.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western">&quot;Creating a desktop icon&quot; and &quot;Update
the executable search path&quot; are selected by default. The
remaining options default to un-selected. Select the options you
prefer.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Think twice before selecting &quot;Associate
supported file extensions with GraphicsMagick&quot; since this will
set up approximately fifty file associations, including common
formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, and PDF. These file associations
will be to the 'gmdisplay' program which is suitable for displaying
images, but currently offers little more than that. Windows XP seems
to handle the file assocations pretty well, allowing you to choose
from a list of programs, but older systems like Windows NT 4.0 and
Windows '98 only support a single association per format, which can
be quite annoying. Associations for GraphicsMagick's native formats
(such as MIFF) will always be made.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Once you have made your selections, click on
&ldquo;Next&gt;&rdquo; to continue. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Ready to Install</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A screen is displayed which displays the selected
options. If you are not satisfied with a selected option, then click
on &ldquo;&lt;Back&rdquo; to go back to a previous screen so that the
option may be adjusted. If you are satisfied with the options and are
ready to install, then select &ldquo;Install&rdquo;. To abort the
installation entirely, select &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo;. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Installation Progress</H4>
<P CLASS="western">While the install program is performing the
installation, it will display what it is doing in an installation
progress window. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Final Information</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A summary of post-install steps is provided. These
steps include some commands you can execute to make sure that
GraphicsMagick is working, as well as some notes about what has been
installed on your system, and where to find additional information.
Once you have read this information, click on &ldquo;Next&gt;&rdquo;
to continue. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Finishing Up</H4>
<P CLASS="western">By default &ldquo;View GraphicsMagick.html&rdquo;
is check-marked. This causes the GraphicsMagick web pages to be
displayed in your web browser when &ldquo;Finish&rdquo; is selected.
If you do not want to view the web pages, then de-select &ldquo;View
GraphicsMagick.html&rdquo;. Select &ldquo;Finish&rdquo; to exit the
installation program. <BR>Under Windows '95 and Windows '98 it will
be necessary to reboot the system in order for some settings to take
effect (such as executable search path) since these are set in
autoexec.bat. Please verify that autoexec.bat is updated correctly.
We have received some reports that the path in autoexec.bat is not
always updated correctly.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Testing The Installation</H4>

GraphicsMagick installation package along with your own package.</P>

that use GraphicsMagick without requiring building GraphicsMagick
from source code, the header files and link libraries required to
build programs using Visual C++ 7.0 are provided in &ldquo;include&rdquo;

directory. Using these headers and libraries to build your dependent
application ensures that they will be compatible with the release
DLLs.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Note that the DLLs and libraries are built using
Visual C++ 7.0 (.net). In order to use Magick++, you must either use
the same compiler version used to build the distribution, or download
the Windows source package and build everything yourself. While it
should be possible to use the free MinGW gcc compiler with the
CORE_RL_magick_.dll (GraphicsMagick C library), it will certainly not
be possible to use it with CORE_RL_Magick++_.dll (GraphicsMagick C++
library) due to name mangling differences.</P>

particular version of GraphicsMagick built with a specific
