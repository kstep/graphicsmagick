This file records noteworthy changes in Magick++.  As of Magick++ 5.2.3,
Magick++ release numbering tracks ImageMagick release numbering so the
Magick++ release number increments even if there are no changes associated
with Magick++ itself.

<p>
(5.3.9)<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> No changes.

</UL>
<p>

<UL>
  <LI> Image colorMap method automatically extends the colormap if index
    is past the end of the current colormap.

  <LI> Added clipMask method to add a clip mask to the current
    image. Prevents modification to image pixels wherever the
    associated clip mask image is tranparent.

<UL>
  <LI> Released with ImageMagick 5.1.0
  <LI> Added additional constructors, read, and write methods for BLOBs
    to make BLOBs easier to use.<BR>
  <LI> Added the medianFilter() method to Image.
  <LI> Renamed transformColorSpace() to colorSpace() and added a
    colorSpace() accessor method.<BR>
  <LI> Renamed psPageSize() to page(), which now properly returns the
    actual attribute from the image, rather than the image options.
    This is important in order to manipulate GIF animations.
  <LI> Bug fixes.

</UL>
<p>
(0.9)<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> Ported to ImageMagick 5.0.
  <LI> BLOB sizes are now specified using size_t type.

  <LI> Shear() No longer accepts a crop option.
  <LI> FontPointsize() now takes a double.

    since ImageMagick 5.0 no longer uses run-length encoding.
  <LI> The quantizeError method has been removed since it never worked.
  <LI> The cacheThreshold method is added to set the threshold of
    ImageMagick's image cache.

</UL>
<p>
(0.8.9)<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> Released with ImageMagick 4.2.9
  <LI> Blob reference counting was totally broken, leading to a memory
    leak if it was used.  Fixed by starting reference count from one
    rather than zero.

</UL>
<p>
(0.8.8)<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> Fixed a Image constructor bug when constructing from a Blob

</UL>
<p>
(0.8.7)<BR>
<UL>

</UL>
<p>
(0.8.6)<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> Color is now based on ImageMagick's RunlengthPacket structure (via a
    pointer) so that it may eventually be used to represent an image
    pixel.  This is currently a work in progress.

</UL>
<p>
(0.8.5)<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> Headers are now installed under prefix/include/Magick++ on Unix
    systems with the exception that Magick++.h is installed under
    prefix/include as it was before.  Programs which include Magick++.h
    (the documented approach) should not be impacted.
  <LI> Image constructors to construct an image from a BLOB.
  <LI> Image read and write methods to decode and encode images stored in a
    BLOB.  This allows reading/writing image "files" from/to memory rather
    than a traditional file.

</UL>
<p>
(0.8.4)<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> New mapImages algorithm maps a sequence of images to the colormap of
    a provided image.<BR>

    derived class.

</UL>
<p>

  <LI> Added Blob class to support supplying formatted binary data to methods.
  <LI> Added support for setting ICC and IPTC profiles from a binary BLOB.
  <LI> Added support for transformations of image data to/from alternate
    colorspace (e.g. CYMK).<BR>
  <LI> Added support for 'pinging' an image (get image dimensions/size quickly).
  <LI> Added 'uncondense' method to de-compress in-memory image data.
  <LI> Added support for annotation using rotated text.

</UL>
<p>
(0.8.1)<BR>

  <LI> Added animateImages() and displayImages() to MagickSTL.h.
  <LI> Added function objects to support setting image attributes.

</UL>
<p>
(0.7.3)<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> Image::penTexture() now takes Image reference rather than
    Image pointer.  Set Image to invalid using isValid(false)
    to unset texture.<BR>
  <LI> Attribute methods that take Color, Geometry, Image, or string
    arguments may now unset the attribute by setting the state of
    the object to invalid using isValid(false), or the empty string
    (in the case of string).  This allows full control over ImageMagick
    attributes which are stored as C strings which may be set to NULL.
  <LI> Updated for ImageMagick 4.2.1

</UL>
<p>
(0.7.2)<BR>
<UL>

<UL>
  <LI> All ImageMagick operations which operate on individual images are
    supported.<BR>
  <LI> Image objects have value semantics, avoid unnecessary image

    separate classes.<BR>
  <LI> Errors are reported synchronously via C++ exceptions.
