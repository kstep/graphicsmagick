	themselves needing to enable OpenMP.
	* magick/command.c (CompositeImageList): Don't overwrite matte
	flag for CopyOpacity composition.
	* magick/composite.c (CompositeImage): CopyOpacity composition
	needs the opacity channel to be enabled.

	declare them as private for OpenMP.
	* configure.ac, PerlMagick/Makefile.PL.in: Added OpenMP support
	for parallelizing a task across multiple cores.  OpenMP support is
	disabled by default so that there is no impact to the existing
	GraphicsMagick 1.2 ABI unless it is intentionally included in the
	build.

2008-05-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/resize.c (ResizeImage): Optimize VerticalFilter and

	server, printer, or the launch delegate.
	* config/Makefile.am (configshare_DATA): Install colors.mgk in
	share path.
	* magick/blob.c (GetConfigureBlob): Search 'share' config path
	prior to 'lib' config path.

	supposed to be using it!
	* libtool: Updated to GNU libtool 1.2960 2008-04-19.
	* configure.ac, magick/delegate.h: It seems that the modern
	convention is to store ghostscript headers in a subdirectory
	called 'ghostscript' rather than 'ps'.
	We don't actually need Ghostscript errors.h and that is a good
	thing since it seems that some newer Ghostscript calls it ierrors.h

2008-04-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/dpx.c (WriteDPXImage): Fix typo in casts.
	* coders/fpx.c (ReadFPXImage): Apply FreeBSD patch from Mikhail
	Teterin to allow FlashPIX to work better for 64-bit builds.

2008-03-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* CONTRIBUTE.txt: Convert contribute.html to reStucturedText
	format and generate HTML version from it.
	* PROCESS.txt: Convert description of development process to
	reStucturedText format and generate HTML version from it.

	* Copyright.txt: Reformat in reStucturedText format and generate
	HTML version from it.
	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/body.isx: No longer include
	development headers and libraries in the Windows DLL install
	package since they are large and they may only work with the
	version of Visual C++ used to perform the build.  It is much safer
	for the developer to build the package from source with his own
	compiler.

2008-03-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Fix compilation issues with Microsoft Visual Studio.

2008-03-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/dpx.c (ReadDPXImage, WriteDPXImage): Use lookup tables to
	speed up value conversion.
	* magick/memory.h (MagickAllocateArray): Renamed from
	MagickAllocateMemoryElements.

2008-03-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Use memory allocation macros like the rest
	of the code.

	PopImageList, PostscriptGeometry, PushImageList,
	SetCacheThreshold, SetImageList, ShiftImageList, SizeBlob,
	SpliceImageList, UnshiftImageList): Remove functions which were
	already deprecated in ImageMagick 5.5.2 or earlier.

2008-03-24  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/dpx.c (WriteDPXImage): Support writing image which is
	already in a YCbCr colorspace.
	(ReadDPXImage): Return YCbCr images in YCbCr colorspace unless

	improved performance.
	* magick/image.c (GetImageDepth): Use table lookups to improve
	performance.

2008-03-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (AllocateImage): Transfer any attributes from
	ImageInfo to allocated image.
	(SetImageDepth): Use table lookups to improve performance.

2008-03-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImageCommand): Added an
	-output-directory option to 'mogrify' to send output files to the
	specified directory.

2008-03-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

2008-02-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/constitute.c (ReadImage): Disable colorspace override
	code since it was being wrongly-triggered in X11 display commands.

2008-02-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/body.html: Update to mention 1.1.11 release.

2008-02-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/colorspace.c (RndToInt): Cast result to 'unsigned int'
	rather than 'int' in order to avoid possible value truncation with
	Q32 build.  Problem was reported by Kai-Uwe Behrmann.
	(TransformRGBImage): Fix loop iterator which was looping one past
	the end of the array.  Reported by Kai-Uwe Behrmann.
	* magick/command.c: Added a -set option to the composite, convert,

2008-02-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Use MagickAcquireMemory() rather than
	AquireMemory().
	* coders/xwd.c (ReadXWDImage): Eliminate integer overflow
	vulnerability (IDefense 09.19.07).
	* coders/xbm.c (ReadXBMImage): ditto
	* coders/xcf.c (ReadXCFImage): ditto
	* coders/dib.c (ReadDIBImage): ditto
	* coders/dcm.c (ReadDCMImage): ditto

2008-02-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): The RFC 2301 specification for
	Internet FAX recommends LSB2MSB fill order so document that.

2008-02-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): Use '-define
	tiff:fill-order={msb2lsb|lsb2msb}' to control TIFF bit fill order.

2008-02-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Updated to latest CVS libtool.
	* coders/tiff.c (CompressionSupported): Use
	TIFFGetConfiguredCODECs() to test if a requested compression type
	is supported by libtiff.  Based on advice from Frank Warmerdam.
	* configure.ac: Add test for TIFFGetConfiguredCODECs() in libtiff.

2008-02-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c: With libtiff 3.6.1, including tiff.h and tiffio.h
	is not sufficient to obtain the definitions from tiffconf.h so
	libtiff is assumed to not support any features, such as
	compression.  Avoid this problem by explicitly including
	tiffconf.h if it is found.  This resolves SourceForge issue
	[1883527] compression of tiff-file has no effect.

2008-02-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/setup.isx: Set Inno Setup installer
	compression to "lzma/max".
	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Eliminate use of memory allocation macros
	since these failed miserably under Windows where it seems that
	malloc, free, and realloc are redefined via macros by the Perl
	build environment.  This reverts changes made on 2007-12-01.
	* magick/memory.c (MagickAcquireMemoryArray): Use implementation
	from the 1.1 branch.
	* magick/utility.h: Remove MagickSafeMultiplySize_t since it seems
	that use of inline functions in Windows is a disaster area.

2008-02-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Makefile.am (windows-dist): Create a 7z compressed Windows
	comprehensive source package.  See http://www.7-zip.org/ for
	information on Windows 7-Zip and http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/ for
	information on portable 7-Zip (P7ZIP).

2008-02-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): Add logging for image resolution
	and resolution units.
	* magick/version.h.in: Update copyright year to 2008.

2008-02-01  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>
	
	* configure.ac: Updated for libtool-2.1b.
	* bootstrap (libtoolize): Libtoolize can figure out the mode and
	directory for libltdl from configure.ac.

2008-01-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* magick/Makefile.am: Update
	magick_libGraphicsMagick_la_DEPENDENCIES to use LTDLDEPS.

2008-01-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (SetImageInfo): Successfully read existing file
	names in the form file[123] which were failing to read since they
	appear to be a valid sub-image specification.

2008-01-24  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.c (ExpandFilenames): If a filename appears to
	contain a wildcard specification, first check to see if there is
	file matching the unexpanded wildcard prior to engaging in the
	slow task of wildcard expansion.  Without this fix, expanding the
	command line takes a very long time if there are a huge number of
	files in the directory, and some file names appear to contain
	wildcard specifications.  Inspired by SourceForge bug reports [
	1878992 ] "literal square brackets in file name cause large delay"
	and [ 1783209 ] "converting runs slowly when subimage is
	specified", but this might not be the complete fix for the
	problem.

2008-01-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Makefile.am: Update to Automake 1.10.1 and enable generation of
	an lzma compressed source package.

2008-01-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Added configure option --with-umem to enable use
	of the umem memory allocation library available in Solaris 9,
	Update 3 and later, or from
	https://labs.omniti.com/trac/portableumem/.  This library supports
	concurrency in multi-threaded programs and supports debugging
	memory issues.  See
	http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/libumem_library.html
	for a description of how to use the library for debugging memory
	issues.

2008-01-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (VersionCommand): Include a "Large Memory" item
	in the Feature Support list.
	* coders/png.c (RegisterPNGImage): Remove reference to dead PNG
	ftp site.
	* VisualMagick/configure/configure.cpp (InitInstance): Remove
	project dependency on dxguid.lib (Direct-X).

2008-01-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Update libtool to latest CVS version.

2008-01-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (DisplayImageCommand): No longer default to
	reading standard input if stdin fails isatty() test.  This
	behavior was causing failure to launch from Gnome and it is
	difficult to work around the issue from within a .desktop file.	
	(AnimateImageCommand): No longer default to
	reading standard input if stdin fails isatty() test.
