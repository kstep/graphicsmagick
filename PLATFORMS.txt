This file provides platform specific portability notes which don't
belong in README.txt. Usually ImageMagick compiles fine according to the
procedures described in README.txt, but sometimes a platform related
oddity causes a failure.

Linux 6.1
=========

  Problem

    When '-rpath /somedir' is added to LDFLAGS in order to tell the
    linker to apply a run-time linker path, configure fails.

  Indications

    The configure script prints the error message

      checking for executable suffix...
                                  configure: error: cannot compute EXEEXT:

    and the error message

      gcc: unrecognized option `-rpath'

    is written to config.log

  Solution

    Use 'LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath,/somedir' instead to pass the options through
    to the linker.

FreeBSD 3.X and 4.X
===================

  Problem
  
    ImageMagick does not run after it is installed. The system does not
    see an installed shared library until the 'ltconfig' command has
    been executed (as root) using the correct options.

  Indications
  
    System fails to find shared library needed by ImageMagick.

  Solution
  
    Either reboot the system (which automatically runs ldconfig) or
    execute

      /sbin/ldconfig -m ${PREFIX}/lib

    where ${PREFIX} is the prefix used when configuring ImageMagick
    (default /usr/local).

Digital Unix and OSF/1
======================

  Problem
  
    Digital Unix provides an outdated JPEG shared library as part of the
    system.
    
  Indications

    ImageMagick fails to link.

  Solution
  
    Ensure that the JPEG library you installed is used. Be sure to
    install the JPEG library as a shared library.

Solaris 2.X
============

  Problem
  
    An outdated delegate library is used rather than the one just
    installed.
    
  Indications
  
    o Failure to link
    o Failure to run properly
    o The command 'ldd `which convert`' lists the wrong library.
  
  Solution

    If the problem library is a shared library (.so extension) then
    install your own library as a shared library. Then add the required
    -L and -R options to find your shared library at both link and run
    time. For example, if your library is is installed in /usr/local/lib:
      
      configure LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib' 

  Problem

    An outdated libtiff.so (libtiff.so.3) is installed in
    /usr/openwin/lib. This library may be used by accident rather than
    the intended libtiff.so, or libtiff.a. In particular, the linker
    generally considers linking against a shared library before it
    considers static libraries, so the system libtiff.so may be used
    even though there is an installed libtiff.a earlier in the linker
    search path.

  Indications
  
    ImageMagick fails to link or load TIFF files.

  Solution

    o Install libtiff as a shared library, and make sure that LDFLAGS
      contains the required -L and -R options to find your shared
      library at both link and run time. For example, if libtiff.so is
      installed in /usr/local/lib:
      
      configure LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib'

    or
      
    o Remove /usr/openwin/lib/libtiff.so.3. Note that if you take this
      step, some tools like 'imagetool' and 'pageview' will stop working.

  Problem
  
    When using gcc 3.0.1, configure decides that the compiler is insufficient
    to compile Magick++.
    
  Indications
  
    Fails ISO C++ test.
  
  Solution

    The problem is due to gcc provided headers undefining Solaris-provided
    defines for 64-bit versions of stdio functions.  The solution is to
    either configure with --disable-largefile or edit the installed
    g++-v3/bits/std_cstdio.h to bracket the offending undefs (for fgetpos,
    fopen, freopen, fsetpos, & tmpfile) like:

    #if _FILE_OFFSET_BITS != 64
    #undef fopen
    #endif
