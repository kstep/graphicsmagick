The ImageMagick Studio LLC development group announces the release of
ImageMagick 5.3.9.  Version 5.3.9 is a bug-fix release to resolve bugs
reported against 5.3.8, 5.3.8.1, and 5.3.8.2.

ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries to read,
write, and manipulate an image in many image formats (over 72 major
formats) including popular formats like FlashPIX, GIF, JPEG, PDF, PNG,
Photo CD, SVG, TIFF, and WMF.  With ImageMagick you can create images
dynamically, making it suitable for Web applications.  You can also
resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an
image and save your completed work in the same or differing image
format.  Image processing operations are available from the command
line, as well as through C, C++, and PERL-based programming
interfaces.

ImageMagick is copyrighted by ImageMagick Studio, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely
available.  ImageMagick is available for free, may be used to support
both open and proprietary applications, and may be redistributed
without fee.

Significant changes from the 5.3.8.2 release (see release ChangeLog
for details):

  o Many bugs fixed which were reported via the ImageMagick bug
    tracking system, or via the mailing lists.

  o ImageMagick is now optimized when compiled as a 64-bit application
    using the LP64 data model in which pointers and longs are increased
    to 64-bits. This allows power users who have access to 64-bit
    machines with large memory to process extremely large images (>2GB)
    entirely in main memory rather than as a memory-mapped temporary
    file. The use of main memory provides an observed performance
    improvement on the order of 18 times over use of a temporary file.

  o Added a MATLAB encoder contributed by Jaroslav Fojtik.

  o Text drawing now handles UTF8-encoding.

  o PingImage() now reports attributes for all images in an image
    sequence.

  o C++ API enhancements (since 5.3.8):

    - Added interfaces to obtain image format support information.

    - Image 'depth' method now inspects (or modifies) image pixels.

    - Support added for adjusting overall image opacity.

    - Support added for adjusting image storage type (e.g.
      TrueColor --> GrayScale).

    - Fixed long-standing bug with Blob design that caused it to
      improperly mix use of memory allocation systems. User may now
      specify memory allocator used for supplied Blob.

    - Image colorMap method automatically extends the colormap.

ImageMagick is developed by the members of the ImageMagick Studio
team:

John Cristy           - Principal designer and author.
Bob Friesenhahn       - Magick++, Unix modules, magic, configure, CVS,
                        tests, bug tracking, and WMF.
William Radcliffe     - VisualMagick, FlashPix, TIFF, timers, watermarking,
                        Windows modules, and fast polygon renderer.
Glenn Randers-Pehrson - PNG, MNG, and test script improvements
Leonard Rosenthol     - Mac support and drawing enhancements.

We would like to give special thanks to several people who assist with
ImageMagick:

Alexander Zimmermann  - Linux binary distributions.
Jaroslav Fojtik       - CUT, ART, and MATLAB coder modules.

There are many other individual contributors, some of whom made
contributions to ImageMagick but shall remain nameless anyway.
